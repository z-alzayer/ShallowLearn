# ShallowLearn: Shallow Water Imaging in Python

## Overview

ShallowLearn is a Python package for processing and analyzing imagery data of shallow water environments. This package is designed to provide an efficient and effective way to calculate common indices used in marine and environmental science, as well as having a basic toolbox for datascience applications for Shallow Water Imaging.

Revision of the repo is still in progress so whilst the main ideas will not change, there maybe some refactoring and reorganisation in the long term to clarify certain parts of the code. For now this is a very alpha stage release. The documentation for the code exists in the github pages and most things should be working but expect bugs and unclear error messages in its current state.
