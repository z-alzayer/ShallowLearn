  abstract     = {The Sentinel-2A and 2B Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) offers a specification of potential value toward a number of objectives in remote sensing of coral reefs. Coral reefs represent a unique challenge for remote sensing, being highly heterogeneous at metre scales and occurring at variable depths and water clarity regimes. However, conservation initiatives, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, add urgency to the need for the large scale environmental monitoring information that remote sensing can provide. In the quest to meet this challenge a range of satellite instruments have been leveraged, from Landsat to high spatial resolution sensors such as WorldView-2, toward objectives such as: mapping of bottom types, bathymetry, change detection, and detection of coral bleaching events. Sentinel-2A and 2B offer a new paradigm of available instruments, with a 5-day revisit, 10 m multispectral spatial resolution and freely available data. Pre-launch simulation analyses by several of the authors suggested Sentinel-2 would have good performance for reef applications, in this paper we follow up on this study by reviewing the potential based on the substantial archive of actual data now available. First we determine to what extent the World's reefs are covered by Sentinel-2, since the mission requirements do not by default include all reefs. Secondly we review how a 5-day revisit translates to a usable acquisition rate of clear images, given that cloud and surface glint are common confounding factors. The usable acquisition rate is the real determinant of the objectives to which the data can be applied. Finally we apply current processing algorithms to Sentinel-2 data of several sites over the Great Barrier Reef, including physics-based bathymetry inversion and object-orientated benthic mapping. Landsat 8 OLI is most comparable current sensor to Sentinel-2 MSI, so direct comparisons and the possibilities for data synthesis are explored. Our findings confirm that Sentinel-2 has excellent performance for meeting several essential coral reef scientific and monitoring objectives. Taking into account cloud and sun glint, the usable acquisition rate for a large proportion of reefs is likely to be around 20 clear images a year on average, giving a new potential for evaluation of short time-scale disturbances and impacts. The spatial resolution of 10 m is a key threshold for delineating benthic features of interest such as coral structures, and there is evidence from image and field data that bleaching is detectable. Radiometrically Sentinel-2 data can support good results in physics-based methods, such as bathymetric mapping, comparable to Landsat 8 and WorldView-2. In addition the large scale acquisition area, provided by the 290 km wide swath, offers advantages over high spatial resolution imagery for mapping at multi-reef scales. Sentinel-2 data can be immediately leveraged with existing methods, to provide a new level of reef monitoring information compared to that previously available by remote sensing. Combined with Landsat 8 and the historical Landsat archive, the data collected today will be invaluable for decades or even centuries to come. In this context, the main downside of the Sentinel-2 mission is that approximately 12% of the World's reefs currently lie outside the acquisition plan and are not imaged. Surprisingly, for a European initiative, coral reefs in European governed territories are among the worst served globally. These omissions, approximately only 1/200th of the currently imaged area, limit the global scope which otherwise would be one of Sentinel-2's greatest strengths.}

  abstract     = {Since the early 1980s, episodes of coral reef bleaching and mortality, due primarily to climate-induced ocean warming, have occurred almost annually in one or more of the world's tropical or subtropical seas. Bleaching is episodic, with the most severe events typically accompanying coupled ocean–atmosphere phenomena, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which result in sustained regional elevations of ocean temperature. Using this extended dataset (25+ years), we review the short- and long-term ecological impacts of coral bleaching on reef ecosystems, and quantitatively synthesize recovery data worldwide. Bleaching episodes have resulted in catastrophic loss of coral cover in some locations, and have changed coral community structure in many others, with a potentially critical influence on the maintenance of biodiversity in the marine tropics. Bleaching has also set the stage for other declines in reef health, such as increases in coral diseases, the breakdown of reef framework by bioeroders, and the loss of critical habitat for associated reef fishes and other biota. Secondary ecological effects, such as the concentration of predators on remnant surviving coral populations, have also accelerated the pace of decline in some areas. Although bleaching severity and recovery have been variable across all spatial scales, some reefs have experienced relatively rapid recovery from severe bleaching impacts. There has been a significant overall recovery of coral cover in the Indian Ocean, where many reefs were devastated by a single large bleaching event in 1998. In contrast, coral cover on western Atlantic reefs has generally continued to decline in response to multiple smaller bleaching events and a diverse set of chronic secondary stressors. No clear trends are apparent in the eastern Pacific, the central-southern-western Pacific or the Arabian Gulf, where some reefs are recovering and others are not. The majority of survivors and new recruits on regenerating and recovering coral reefs have originated from broadcast spawning taxa with a potential for asexual growth, relatively long distance dispersal, successful settlement, rapid growth and a capacity for framework construction. Whether or not affected reefs can continue to function as before will depend on: (1) how much coral cover is lost, and which species are locally extirpated; (2) the ability of remnant and recovering coral communities to adapt or acclimatize to higher temperatures and other climatic factors such as reductions in aragonite saturation state; (3) the changing balance between reef accumulation and bioerosion; and (4) our ability to maintain ecosystem resilience by restoring healthy levels of herbivory, macroalgal cover, and coral recruitment. Bleaching disturbances are likely to become a chronic stress in many reef areas in the coming decades, and coral communities, if they cannot recover quickly enough, are likely to be reduced to their most hardy or adaptable constituents. Some degraded reefs may already be approaching this ecological asymptote, although to date there have not been any global extinctions of individual coral species as a result of bleaching events. Since human populations inhabiting tropical coastal areas derive great value from coral reefs, the degradation of these ecosystems as a result of coral bleaching and its associated impacts is of considerable societal, as well as biological concern. Coral reef conservation strategies now recognize climate change as a principal threat, and are engaged in efforts to allocate conservation activity according to geographic-, taxonomic-, and habitat-specific priorities to maximize coral reef survival. Efforts to forecast and monitor bleaching, involving both remote sensed observations and coupled ocean–atmosphere climate models, are also underway. In addition to these efforts, attempts to minimize and mitigate bleaching impacts on reefs are immediately required. If significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved within the next two to three decades, maximizing coral survivorship during this time may be critical to ensuring healthy reefs can recover in the long term.}

Direct application to multi- and hyperspectral imagery of supervised (shallow or deep) convolutional networks is very challenging given the high input data dimensionality and the relatively small amount of available labeled data. Therefore, we propose the use of greedy layerwise unsupervised pretraining coupled with a highly efficient algorithm for unsupervised learning of sparse features. The algorithm is rooted on sparse representations and enforces both population and lifetime sparsity of the extracted features, simultaneously. We successfully illustrate the expressive power of the extracted representations in several scenarios: classification of aerial scenes, as well as land-use classification in very high resolution or land-cover classification from multi- and hyperspectral images. The proposed algorithm clearly outperforms standard principal component analysis (PCA) and its kernel counterpart (kPCA), as well as current state-of-the-art algorithms of aerial classification, while being extremely computationally efficient at learning representations of data. Results show that single-layer convolutional networks can extract powerful discriminative features only when the receptive field accounts for neighboring pixels and are preferred when the classification requires high resolution and detailed results. However, deep architectures significantly outperform single-layer variants, capturing increasing levels of abstraction and complexity throughout the feature hierarchy.},

The current generation of learning algorithms requires a large volume of data labeled according to a static and pre-defined schema. Conversely, humans can quickly learn generalizations based on large quantities of unlabeled data, and turn these generalizations into classifications using spontaneous labels, often including labels not seen before. We apply a state-of-the-art unsupervised learning algorithm to the noisy and extremely imbalanced xView data set to train a feature extractor that adapts to several tasks: visual similarity search that performs well on both common and rare classes; identifying outliers within a labeled data set; and learning a natural class hierarchy automatically.}

  abstract     = {Sea temperatures in many tropical regions have increased by almost 1°C over the past 100 years, and are currently increasing at ~1-2°C per century. Coral bleaching occurs when the thermal tolerance of corals and their photosynthetic symbionts (zooxanthellae) is exceeded. Mass coral bleaching has occurred in association with episodes of elevated sea temperatures over the past 20 years and involves the loss of the zooxanthellae following chronic photoinhibition. Mass bleaching has resulted in significant losses of live coral in many parts of the world. This paper considers the biochemical, physiological and ecological perspectives of coral bleaching. It also uses the outputs of four runs from three models of global climate change which simulate changes in sea temperature and hence how the frequency and intensity of bleaching events will change over the next 100 years. The results suggest that the thermal tolerances of reef-building corals are likely to be exceeded every year within the next few decades. Events as severe as the 1998 event, the worst on record, are likely to become commonplace within 20 years. Most information suggests that the capacity for acclimation by corals has already been exceeded, and that adaptation will be too slow to avert a decline in the quality of the world's reefs. The rapidity of the changes that are predicted indicates a major problem for tropical marine ecosystems and suggests that unrestrained warming cannot occur without the loss and degradation of coral reefs on a global scale.},

  abstract     = {Coral reef bleaching, the whitening of diverse invertebrate taxa, results from the loss of symbiotic zoo-xanthellae and/or a reduction in photosynthetic pigment concentrations in zooxanthellae residing within the gas-trodermal tissues of host animals. Of particular concern are the consequences of bleaching of large numbers of reef-building scleractinian corals and hydrocorals. Published records of coral reef bleaching events from 1870 to the present suggest that the frequency (60 major events from 1979 to 1990), scale (co-occurrence in many coral reef regions and often over the bathymetric depth range of corals) and severity (> 95% mortality in some areas) of recent bleaching disturbances are unprecedented in the scientific literature. The causes of small scale, isolated bleaching events can often be explained by particular stressors (e.g., temperature, salinity, light, sedimentation, aerial exposure and pollutants), but attempts to explain large scale bleaching events in terms of possible global change (e.g., greenhouse warming, increased UV radiation flux, deteriorating ecosystem health, or some combination of the above) have not been convincing. Attempts to relate the severity and extent of large scale coral reef bleaching events to particular causes have been hampered by a lack of (a) standardized methods to assess bleaching and (b) continuous, long-term data bases of environmental conditions over the periods of interest. An effort must be made to understand the impact of bleaching on the remainder of the reef community and the long-term effects on competition, predation, symbioses, bioerosion and substrate condition, all factors that can influence coral recruitment and reef recovery. If projected rates of sea warming are realized by mid to late AD 2000, i.e. a 2 ~ C increase in high latitude coral seas, the upper thermal tolerance limits of many reef-building corals could be exceeded. Present evidence suggests that many corals would be unable to adapt physiologically or genetically to such marked and rapid temperature increases .}

Extensive loss of reef corals following recent mass bleaching events have challenged the notion that support of system resilience is a viable reef management strategy. While resilience-based management (RBM) cannot prevent the damaging effects of major disturbances, such as mass bleaching events, it can support natural processes that promote resistance and recovery. Here, we review the potential of RBM to help sustain coral reefs in the 21st century. We explore the scope for supporting resilience through existing management approaches and emerging technologies and discuss their opportunities and limitations in a changing climate. We argue that for RBM to be effective in a changing world, reef management strategies need to involve both existing and new interventions that together reduce stress, support the fitness of populations and species, and help people and economies to adapt to a highly altered ecosystem.},

  abstract     = {The ecosystem concept has been applied to coral reefs since the time of Charles Darwin, perhaps because of the apparent integrity of the biotic-abiotic nexus. The modern model of the ecosystem as a hierarchy with emergent properties is exemplified in reefs as massive structures formed by small colonial organisms, the self-similarity of these structures across large spatial scales, and the uniformity of function by diverse biological communities. Emergent properties arise through the integration of processes up the levels of organization and larger spatial and temporal scales encompassed by a whole reef. The organic response of reef morphology to hydrodynamic forcing, the constancy and conservatism of organic production across a broad range of environments, and the global persistence of reefs in the face of massive evolutionary change in species diversity are interpreted as emergent properties. Coral reefs, of course, function by the same basic laws as other ecosystems, but there is cause to view them as an end member of a continuum because of their structural complexity and high internal cycling. Well-defined boundary conditions mean that highly integrative measures of ecosystem process based on physical and biogeochemical models (e.g. community metabolism) have provided the main applications of systems ecology to questions of coral reef function. Organism-population approaches are being reconciled with form-functional models to yield new insights to ecosystem processes and interactions among reefs and adjacent systems. The form and metabolism of reef production are strongly affected by phase shifts in benthic community structure, and most reef systems are more open to trans-boundary fluxes and external forcing than the early models suggest. The attractive paradigm of the reef as a self-sufficient ecosystem is dying slowly as research focus shifts from atolls to more open fringing and bank barrier reefs, and organic inputs to system production are measured. Coral reefs contribute little in a net sense to global ecosystem processes, but on an areal basis their exports of organic products are significant Holistic models and measures of ecosystem processes incorporate the unusual whole-part relationship of reefs and are practically essential to answering the key questions facing coral reef science in the next millennium. © Springer-Verlag 1997.},

We synthesize current understanding of the relationships between ecological services and functional groups of species and biological communities of coral reefs in different regions of the world. The consequences of human impacts on coral reefs are also discussed, including loss of resilience, or buffer capacity. Such loss may impair the capacity for recovery of coral reefs and as a consequence the quality and quantity of their delivery of ecological goods and services. Conserving the capacity of reefs to generate essential services requires that they are managed as components of a larger seascape-landscape of which human activities are seen as integrated parts.},

  abstract     = {With uninterrupted space-based data collection since 1972, Landsat plays a key role in systematic monitoring of the Earth’s surface, enabled by an extensive and free, radiometrically consistent, global archive of imagery. Governments and international organizations rely on Landsat time series for monitoring and deriving a systematic understanding of the dynamics of the Earth’s surface at a spatial scale relevant to management, scientific inquiry, and policy development. In this study, we identify trends in Landsat-informed change detection studies by surveying 50 years of published applications, processing, and change detection methods. Specifically, a representative database was created resulting in 490 relevant journal articles derived from the Web of Science and Scopus. From these articles, we provide a review of recent developments, opportunities, and trends in Landsat change detection studies. The impact of the Landsat free and open data policy in 2008 is evident in the literature as a turning point in the number and nature of change detection studies. Based upon the search terms used and articles included, average number of Landsat images used in studies increased from 10 images before 2008 to 100,000 images in 2020. The 2008 opening of the Landsat archive resulted in a marked increase in the number of images used per study, typically providing the basis for the other trends in evidence. These key trends include an increase in automated processing, use of analysis-ready data (especially those with atmospheric correction), and use of cloud computing platforms, all over increasing large areas. The nature of change methods has evolved from representative bi-temporal pairs to time series of images capturing dynamics and trends, capable of revealing both gradual and abrupt changes. The result also revealed a greater use of nonparametric classifiers for Landsat change detection analysis. Landsat-9, to be launched in September 2021, in combination with the continued operation of Landsat-8 and integration with Sentinel-2, enhances opportunities for improved monitoring of change over increasingly larger areas with greater intra-and interannual frequency.},

Now, having collected earth observation data for well over four decades since the 1972 launch of Landsat-1, the Landsat program is increasingly complex and vibrant. Critical programmatic elements are ensuring the continuity of high quality measurements for scientific and operational investigations, including ground systems, acquisition planning, data archiving and management, and provision of analysis ready data products. Free and open access to archival and new imagery has resulted in a myriad of innovative applications and novel scientific insights. The planning of future compatible satellites in the Landsat series, which maintain continuity while incorporating technological advancements, has resulted in an increased operational use of Landsat data. Governments and international agencies, among others, can now build an expectation of Landsat data into a given operational data stream. International programs and conventions (e.g., deforestation monitoring, climate change mitigation) are empowered by access to systematically collected and calibrated data with expected future continuity further contributing to the existing multi-decadal record. The increased breadth and depth of Landsat science and applications have accelerated following the launch of Landsat-8, with significant improvements in data quality. Herein, we describe the programmatic developments and institutional context for the Landsat program and the unique ability of Landsat to meet the needs of national and international programs. We then present the key trends in Landsat science that underpin many of the recent scientific and application developments and follow-up with more detailed thematically organized summaries. The historical context offered by archival imagery combined with new imagery allows for the development of time series algorithms that can produce information on trends and dynamics. Landsat-8 has figured prominently in these recent developments, as has the improved understanding and calibration of historical data. Following the communication of the state of Landsat science, an outlook for future launches and envisioned programmatic developments are presented. Increased linkages between satellite programs are also made possible through an expectation of future mission continuity, such as developing a virtual constellation with Sentinel-2. Successful science and applications developments create a positive feedback loop—justifying and encouraging current and future programmatic support for Landsat.},

  abstract     = {Coal mining activities cause an increased acidity and an associated decrease of the pH-value in mine waters. This process is also known as acid mine drainage (AMD). Due to AMD, lakes that were formed in the post mining landscapes in the lignite mining area of Central Germany are characterized by specific limnological development changes. Remote sensing is a time and cost saving technique that enables the observation of the hydrological and limnological development of the lakes ranging from a small to a mid size scale. The current research was based on Landsat TM5/ETM+7 satellite data collected between 1999 and 2004. In combination of satellite data, surface waters of the post mining lakes in Central Germany were sampled and analyzed for their physicochemical properties. The objective of this approach was to evaluate the environmental conditions and to develop a monitoring system. On the other hand, the research was conducted to assess the potential of the use of satellite data and to calibrate its content for monitoring the geochemistry of mining lakes. Correlation of hydrochemical parameters of lake water to spectral signatures detected by satellites was performed with multivariate statistical analysis methods. The five determined clusters of spectral partitions described the actual data (ground truth data) within the visible range. The statistically identified clusters were combined with expert knowledge in limnology, geology and water chemistry of large scale lakes in open cast mining areas, in order to analyze the spectral information of the satellite images scientifically. The utilization of spectral signatures revealed an acceptable classification of hydrological and hydrochemical properties of mining lakes and established the basis for further investigation of open cast lignite mining concerning the environmental impact, particularly in areas where lignite mining lakes usually form. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms.

Conservation and management imply continuous monitoring and mapping of their spatial distribution at first. The present study explores the capabilities of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission and the contribution of its coastal aerosol band 1 (443 nm) for the mapping of the dominant Mediterranean coastal marine habitats and the bathymetry in three survey sites in the East Mediterranean. The selected sites have shallow to deep habitats and a high variability of oceanographic and seabed morphological conditions. The major findings of our study demonstrate the advantages of the downscaled Sentinel-2 coastal aerosol band 1 for both optically shallow habitat and satellite-derived bathymetry mapping due to its great water penetration. The use of Sentinel-2 band 1 allows detection of Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds down to 32.2 m of depth. Sentinel-2 constellation with its 10-m spatial resolution at most of the spectral bands, 5-day revisit frequency and open data policy can be an important tool to provide crucial missing information on the spatial distribution of coastal habitats and on their bathymetry distribution, especially in data-poor and/or remote areas with large gaps in a retrospective, rapid and non-intrusive manner. As such, it becomes a crucial ally for the conservation and management of coastal habitats globally.},

However, the existing techniques either cannot avoid distorting the image spectral properties or involve complicated and time-consuming frequency decomposition and re-construction processing. A simple spectral preserve fusion technique: The Smoothing Filter-based Intensity Modulation (SFIM) has thus been developed based on a simplified solar radiation and land surface reflection model. By using a ratio between a higher resolution image and its low pass filtered (with a smoothing filter) image, spatial details can be modulated to a co-registered lower resolution multispectral image without altering its spectral properties and contrast. The technique can be applied to improve spatial resolution for either colour composites or individual bands. The fidelity to spectral property and the spatial textural quality of SFIM are convincingly demonstrated by an image fusion experiment using TM and SPOT Panchromatic images of south-east Spain. The visual evaluation and statistical analysis compared with HSI and Brovey transform techniques confirmed that SFIM is a superior fusion technique for improving spatial detail of multispectral images with their spectral properties reliably preserved.},

Imagery from the operational land imager (OLI) on Landsat 8, the multispectral instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2 A and B, and the PlanetScope CubeSat constellation was processed for both sites using a fixed atmospheric path reflectance in a small region of interest around the system’s deployment location, using a number of processing settings, including a new sky reflectance correction. The mean absolute relative differences (MARD) between in situ and satellite measured reflectances reach <20% in the Blue and 11% in the Green bands around 490 and 560 nm for the best performing configuration for MSI and OLI. Higher relative errors are found for the shortest Blue bands around 440 nm (30–100% MARD), and in the Red-Edge and near-infrared bands (35–100% MARD), largely influenced by the lower absolute data range in the observations. Root mean squared differences (RMSD) increase from 0.005 in the NIR to about 0.015–0.020 in the Blue band, consistent with increasing atmospheric path reflectance. Validation of the Red-Edge and NIR bands on Sentinel-2 is presented, as well as for the first time, the Panchromatic band (17–26% MARD) on Landsat 8, and the derived Orange contra-band (8–33% MARD for waters in the algorithm domain, and around 40–80% MARD overall). For Sentinel-2, excluding the SWIR bands from the DSF gave better performances, likely due to calibration issues of MSI at longer wavelengths. Excluding the SWIR on Landsat 8 gave good performance as well, indicating robustness of the DSF to the available band set. The DSF performance was found to be rather insensitive to (1) the wavelength spacing in the lookup tables used for the atmospheric correction, (2) the use of default or ancillary information on gas concentration and atmospheric pressure, and (3) the size of the ROI over which the path reflectance is estimated. The performance of the PlanetScope constellation is found to be similar to previously published results, with the standard DSF giving the best results in the visible bands in terms of MARD (24–40% overall, and 18–29% for the turbid site). The new sky reflectance correction gave mixed results, although it reduced the mean biases for certain configurations and improved results for the processing excluding the SWIR bands, giving lower RMSD and MARD especially at longer wavelengths (>600 nm). The results presented in this article should serve as guidelines for general use of ACOLITE and the DSF.},

The availability of habitats maps improves management by guiding sampling strategies, mapping resources, involving local communities, identifying conservation areas, and facilitating Ecosystem Based Fishery Management (EBFM) approaches. However, despite their potential, very little use of products designed specifically for fishery management can be reported, likely due to high costs, inherent technology limitations and lack of awareness on the possibilities.

Its spectral resolution and quality are high but its spatial resolutions, of at most 10 m, is not sufficient for fine scale analysis. A novel method was thus proposed to super-resolve S2 imagery to 2.5 m. For a given S2 tile, the 10 S2 bands (four at 10mand six at 20 m) were fused with additional images acquired at higher spatial resolution by the PlanetScope (PS) constellation. The radiometric inconsistencies between PS microsatellites were normalized. Radiometric normalization and super-resolution were achieved simultaneously using state-of-the-art super-resolution residual convolutional neural networks adapted to the particularities of S2 and PS imageries (including masks of clouds and shadows). The method is described in detail, from image selection and downloading to neural network architecture, training, and prediction. The quality was thoroughly assessed visually (photointerpretation) and quantitatively, confirming that the proposed method is highly spatially and spectrally accurate. The method is also robust and can be applied to S2 images acquired worldwide at any date.},

Recently, corals harbouring Symbiodinium thermophilum, a thermotolerant microalgae, were found to be prevalent among UAE reefs and were reported to endure extreme sea-surface temperatures. Late 2015–early 2016 was marked with the strongest El Niño on record worldwide, which caused massive coral bleaching (loss of symbiotic microalgae from reef-building corals). In September 2015, the waters flanking UAE coasts were identified to be among the areas facing a thermal stress reaching its highest level liable to cause massive coral bleaching. However, the effect of this thermal stress on UAE corals remained largely unknown. Here, multi-temporal DubaiSat-2 satellite images were used to show that changes in the reef environment of Dalma Island, UAE, between 2014 and 2016, occurred in macroalgae-dominant habitats, whereas live corals remained unaltered. Furthermore, extending the study to a larger area helped in discovering a continuum of live and pristine corals, which was not reported or studied before. While sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1°C were reported to significantly damage coral reefs around the world, the live coral habitat was observed to exhibit no-change despite four consecutive months of +2°C to 3°C anomalies reported during the study period. These findings point to the tolerance of UAE live corals faced with extreme climate conditions.},

This study developed a machine learning model using the extreme gradient boosting method to predict vegetation growth throughout the growing season in China from 2001 to 2018. The model used satellite-derived vegetation data for the first month of each growing season, CO2 concentration, and several meteorological factors as data sources for the explanatory variables. Results showed that the model could reproduce the spatiotemporal distribution of vegetation growth as represented by the satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The predictive error for the growing season NDVI was less than 5% for more than 98% of vegetated areas in China; the model represented seasonal variations in NDVI well. The coefficient of determination (R2) between the monthly observed and predicted NDVI was 0.83, and more than 69% of vegetated areas had an R2 &gt; 0.8. The effectiveness of the model was examined for a severe drought year (2009), and results showed that the model could reproduce the spatiotemporal distribution of NDVI even under extreme conditions. This model provides an alternative method for predicting vegetation growth and has great potential for monitoring vegetation dynamics and crop growth.},

Relaying fieldwork considerably, the remote sensing approach can address this need in offering spectral information relevant for coral health detection with 0.5 m spatial accuracy. We investigated the potential of spectral diversity indices to achieve the discrimination of coral-dominated assemblages and health states from novel satellite imagery (WorldView-2, WV2). Both Equitability’s (E) and Pielou’s (P) operators were used to quantify the evenness of the corrected visible spectral bands (two times 26 combinations of five bands) corresponding to remotely sensed colonies. Three scleractinian corals (Porites lobata, P. rus and Acropora pulchra) that are primarily involved in Moorea’s reef building (French Polynesia) were examined in respect to their health state (healthy or unhealthy, referring to both bleached and dead coral, hereinafter). Using four classifiers, we showed that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) greatly discerned among the six coral classes based upon the five WV2 spectral bands (93%), thus surpassing the classification issued from the three traditionally used bands (80%). Coupling the WV2 dataset with Egreen-red, Eyellow-red or E“coastal”-blue-green allowed the SVM performance to attain 96%. On the other hand, adding the E“coastal”-blue to the WV2-dataset contributed to a substantially increase of the classification accuracy derived from the Random Forest classifier, stepping from 64% to 77%. Significant contributions of spectral diversity indices to surveying coral health were further discussed in the light of spectral properties of coral-related pigments. These findings may play a major role for the extensive monitoring of coral health states at a fine scale, and for the management and restoration of damaged coral reefs.},

These data indicated that the northern Red Sea has not experienced mass bleaching despite intensive Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) of >15°C-weeks. Severe bleaching was restricted to the central and southern Red Sea where DHWs have been more frequent, but far less intense (DHWs <4°C-weeks). A similar pattern was observed during the 2015–2016 El Niño event during which time corals in the northern Red Sea did not bleach despite high thermal stress (i.e. DHWs >8°C-weeks), and bleaching was restricted to the central and southern Red Sea despite the lower thermal stress (DHWs < 8°C-weeks). Heat stress assays carried out in the northern (Hurghada) and central (Thuwal) Red Sea on four key reef-building species confirmed different regional thermal susceptibility, and that central Red Sea corals are more sensitive to thermal anomalies as compared to those from the north. Together, our data demonstrate that corals in the northern Red Sea have a much higher heat tolerance than their prevailing temperature regime would suggest. In contrast, corals from the central Red Sea are close to their thermal limits, which closely match the maximum annual water temperatures. The northern Red Sea harbours reef-building corals that live well below their bleaching thresholds and thus we propose that the region represents a thermal refuge of global importance.},

Here we use a metagenomic approach to identify metabolic and taxonomic shifts in microbial communities associated with the hard coral Acropora millepora throughout a natural thermal bleaching event at Magnetic Island (Great Barrier Reef). A direct comparison of metagenomic data sets from healthy versus bleached corals indicated major shifts in microbial associates during heat stress, including Bacteria, Archaea, viruses, Fungi and micro-algae. Overall, metabolism of the microbial community shifted from autotrophy to heterotrophy, including increases in genes associated with the metabolism of fatty acids, proteins, simple carbohydrates, phosphorus and sulfur. In addition, the proportion of virulence genes was higher in the bleached library, indicating an increase in microorganisms capable of pathogenesis following bleaching. These results demonstrate that thermal stress results in shifts in coral-associated microbial communities that may lead to deteriorating coral health. © 2011 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract     = {Coral reefs are the world’s most diverse marine ecosystems that provide resources and services that benefit millions of people globally. Yet, coral reefs have recently experienced an increase in the frequency and intensity of thermal-stress events that are causing coral bleaching. Coral bleaching is a result of the breakdown of the symbiosis between corals and their symbiotic microalgae, causing the loss of pigments and symbionts, giving corals a pale, bleached appearance. Bleaching can be temporary or fatal for corals, depending on the species, the geographic location, historical conditions, and on local and regional influences. Indeed, marine heat waves are the greatest threat to corals worldwide. Here we compile a Global Coral-Bleaching Database (GCBD) that encompasses 34,846 coral bleaching records from 14,405 sites in 93 countries, from 1980–2020. The GCBD provides vital information on the presence or absence of coral bleaching along with site exposure, distance to land, mean turbidity, cyclone frequency, and a suite of sea-surface temperature metrics at the times of survey.},

As yet, it is not clear whether this resilience is related to the presence of specific symbiont types that are exclusively found in this region. Therefore, we used molecular markers to identify the symbiotic algae of three Porites species along >1000 km of coastline in the PAG and the Gulf of Oman and found that a recently described species, Symbiodinium thermophilum, is integral to coral survival in the southern PAG, the world's hottest sea. Despite the geographic isolation of the PAG, we discovered that representatives of the S. thermophilum group can also be found in the adjacent Gulf of Oman providing a potential source of thermotolerant symbionts that might facilitate the adaptation of Indian Ocean populations to the higher water temperatures expected for the future. However, corals from the PAG associated with S. thermophilum show strong local adaptation not only to high temperatures but also to the exceptionally high salinity of their habitat. We show that their superior heat tolerance can be lost when these corals are exposed to reduced salinity levels common for oceanic environments elsewhere. Consequently, the salinity prevailing in most reefs outside the PAG might represent a distribution barrier for extreme temperature-tolerant coral/Symbiodinium associations from the PAG.},

  abstract     = {'It should be clear that the upper temperature limit for life cannot be accurately defined' (Schmidt-Nielsen 1996). The thermal physiology of zooxanthellate reef corals is reviewed in this paper in the context of organismal and biochemical responses occurring during coral bleaching, with emphasis on methods of detection and interpretation of animal and algal symbiont stress. Coral bleaching, as presently defined in the literature, is a highly subjective term used to describe a variety of conditions pertaining to low symbiont densities in the coral-algal complex, including response to thermal stress. Three general types of high-temperature bleaching are defined: physiological bleaching, which may or may not include higher-than-normal temperature responses; algal-stress bleaching, involving dysfunction of symbiotic algae at high light and/or high temperatures; and animal-stress bleaching, where coral cells containing symbiotic algae are shed from the gastrodermal layer of cells. Since none of these methods of bleaching is mutually exclusive, a combination of intrusive and non-intrusive techniques is necessary to determine which mechanisms of symbiont loss are occurring. While quantification of symbiont densities, algal pigments, and coral tissue biomass provide unambiguous evidence of bleaching severity, measurements of physiological and biochemical degradation offer additional correlative evidence of temperature stress. Pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometry has emerged as an easy and relatively inexpensive non-invasive technique for monitoring symbiotic algal function both in situ and in the laboratory, when proper assumptions and interpretations are made. The roles of global warming, water quality, acclimation/adaptation processes, and relation to coral disease and reef heterogeneity are also discussed. A thorough understanding of the organismal responses occurring during bleaching will help explain changes in coral populations and in the coral reef community, and perhaps assist in predicting the future of reef corals and coral reefs during the next century of global climate change.},

  abstract     = {Seawater reverse osmosis desalination concentrate may have chronic and/or acute impacts on the marine ecosystems in the near-field area of the discharge. Environmental impact of the desalination plant discharge is supposedly site- and volumetric- specific, and also depends on the salinity tolerance of the organisms inhabiting the water column in and around a discharge environment. Scientific studies that aim to understand possible impacts of elevated salinity levels are important to assess detrimental effects to organisms, especially for species with no mechanism of osmoregulation, e.g., presumably corals. Previous studies on corals indicate sensitivity toward hypo- and hyper-saline environments with small changes in salinity already affecting coral physiology. In order to evaluate sensitivity of Red Sea corals to increased salinity levels, we conducted a long-term (29 days) in situ salinity tolerance transect study at an offshore seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) discharge on the coral Fungia granulosa. While we measured a pronounced increase in salinity and temperature at the direct outlet of the discharge structure, effects were indistinguishable from the surrounding environment at a distance of 5 m. Interestingly, corals were not affected by varying salinity levels as indicated by measurements of the photosynthetic efficiency. Similarly, cultured coral symbionts of the genus Symbiodinium displayed remarkable tolerance levels in regard to hypo- and hypersaline treatments. Our data suggest that increased salinity and temperature levels from discharge outlets wear off quickly in the surrounding environment. Furthermore, F. granulosa seem to tolerate levels of salinity that are distinctively higher than reported for other corals previously. It remains to be determined whether Red Sea corals in general display increased salinity tolerance, and whether this is related to prevailing levels of high(er) salinity in the Red Sea in comparison to other oceans.},

  abstract     = {[The fecundity of clonal animals and plants is determined by the number of gravid modules (polyps, zooids, shoots, ramets) and their reproductive output. We examined the fecundity of modules (polyps) and colonies of six reef-building corals (Acropora hyacinthus, A. nana, A. gemmifera, A. millepora, Goniastrea retiformis, and Stylophora postillata) to explore how modularity influences reproductive strategies and the evolution of life histories in clonal animals. In unitary, aclonal organisms, fecundity often reaches a plateau or declines in old age. In contrast, we found that fecundity of colonies was indeterminate because vegetative growth can lead to an indefinite number of repeated, reproductive modules. However, colony fecundity was not a simple linear function of the number of modules. The species ranking of polyp fecundities (G. retiformis > the Acropora species > S. pistillata) was very different from the ranks of size-specific colony fecundities (A. hyacinthus, A. millepora, A. gemmifera > A. nana and G. retiformis). Colony fecundity for small S. pistillata was the lowest of all, but large colonies were more fecund than any of the other species at a comparable colony size (despite Stylophora having the lowest polyp fecundity). This contrast highlights clearly the effects of modularity on the reproductive biology and life histories of clonal organisms. The volume of eggs and testes, and the number of eggs and testes per polyp varied greatly among species (20-, 13-, 17-, and 3-fold, respectively). Egg volume was smallest for S. pistillata (the only brooder in the study) and for G. retiformis (which also had the most eggs per polyp, indicating a trade-off between egg size and number). The total reproductive volume per polyp (egg and testes combined) varied three-fold among the six species, and was correlated with a similar range of polyp diameters. In some cases, components of polyp fecundity depended on colony size; egg size in A. hyacinthus and A. nana and the number of planulae per polyp in S. pistillata increased by two- to fourfold with a one to two order of magnitude change in colony size. However, egg size was constant for the other species. Similarly, colony size had no effect on egg or testes number per polyp or testes volume per polyp for any species. We also found striking differences in sex allocation, which may relate to the fertilization biology of these hermaphroditic species. The ratio of total egg volume to testes volume per polyp varied fivefold, and was lowest for S. pistillata (a brooder) and G. retiformis (which produced the most and smallest eggs). The ratio increased with colony size for all species, especially A. hyacinthus. An early investment predominantly in testes allows sex to commence without the initial expense of egg production, perhaps so that colony growth can continue to a larger, safer size. All species had a characteristic colony size at maturation, which varied ninefold among taxa, corresponding to a minimum puberty age of 1-3 yr. This is the first comparative study to simultaneously measure male and female function in a range of clonal animals.]},

  abstract     = {Coral bleaching, i.e., the loss of photosynthetic algal endosymbionts, caused by ocean warming is now among the main factors driving global reef decline, making the elucidation of factors that contribute to thermotolerance important. Recent studies implicate high salinity as a contributing factor in cnidarians, potentially explaining the high thermotolerance of corals from the Arabian Seas. Here we characterized bacterial community composition under heat stress at different salinities using the coral model Aiptasia. Exposure of two Aiptasia host-algal symbiont pairings (H2-SSB01 and CC7-SSA01) to ambient (25°C) and heat stress (34°C) temperatures at low (36 PSU), intermediate (39 PSU), and high (42 PSU) salinities showed that bacterial community composition at high salinity was significantly different, concomitant with reduced bleaching susceptibility in H2-SSB01, not observed in CC7-SSA01. Elucidation of bacteria that showed increased relative abundance at high salinity, irrespective of heat stress, revealed candidate taxa that could potentially contribute to the observed increased thermotolerance. We identified 4 (H2-SSB01) and 3 (CC7-SSA01) bacterial taxa belonging to the orders Alteromonadales (1 OTU), Oligoflexales (1 OTU), Rhizobiales (2 OTUs), and Rhodobacterales (2 OTUs), suggesting that only few bacterial taxa are potential contributors to an increase in thermal tolerance at high salinities. These taxa have previously been implicated in nitrogen and DMSP cycling, processes that are considered to affect thermotolerance. Our study demonstrates microbiome restructuring in symbiotic cnidarians under heat stress at different salinities. As such, it underlines how host-associated bacterial communities adapt to prevailing environmental conditions with putative consequences for the environmental stress tolerance of the emergent metaorganism.},

  abstract     = {Bleaching (loss of pigmentation by corals) is a widespread phenomenon in coral-reef ecosystems. Despite this, the underlying causes of some forms of bleaching are poorly understood. This study explores the conditions that induce bleaching in two species of reef coral-zooxanthellae associations from Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Naturally bleached Stylophora pistillata Esper and Seriatopora hystrix Dana, collected from the edge of Lizard Island lagoon, had the same amount of Chl a · zooxanthellae−1, yet had reduced population densities of zooxanthellae when compared to normal-looking colonies. In this case, the lack of pigment in the bleached corals was explained by low numbers of zooxanthellae and not by pale zooxanthellae. This is contrary to results obtained by some other workers and suggests that closer inspection of the underlying reasons for the pale color of bleached corals is warranted. In laboratory experiments, sudden exposures to full sunlight induced the bleaching of S. pistillata previously grown at 25% sunlight. The pale color of colonies exposed to full sunlight was explained by the low pigment content of the zooxanthellae rather than by low population densities of zooxanthellae. In addition, the specific expulsion rate of zooxanthellae from S. Pistillata and S. hystrix was not influenced by sudden increases in solar irradiance. Sudden exposures to reduced salinities (30%.) did not affect S. Pistillata or S. hystrix in this study. Both species bleached rapidly, however, when exposed to water temperatures of > 30 °C. Bleached corals in this case had reduced population densities of zooxanthellae despite normal zooxanthella pigment contents. The specific expulsion rate of zooxanthellae from both species of coral was very sensitive to temperature. 7-h exposures to 30 and 32 °C resulted in specific expulsion rates of > 1000 times that of controls. Specific expulsion rates remained high, even when corals were returned to control temperatures (27 °C). After high temperature stress, S. Pistillata and S. hystrix had high and sustained colony respiratory rates (rc), reduced colony photosynthetic rates (pcnetmax) and reduced Pcgmax: rc ratios. The O2 metabolism of the S. pistillata and S. hystrix symbioses remained abnormal for up to 4 days after a 7-h exposure to 32 °C. Evidence suggestive of recovery was apparent 19 days later. By this time, the mean population density of zooxanthellae and pcgmax:rc ratios of exposed fragments had returned to normal.},

Heat stress-mediated episodes of mass coral bleaching have led to catastrophic coral mortality globally. Remotely monitoring and forecasting such biotic responses to heat stress is key for effective marine ecosystem management. The Degree Heating Week (DHW) metric, designed to monitor coral bleaching risk, reflects the duration and intensity of heat stress events and is computed by accumulat-ing SST anomalies (HotSpot) relative to a stress threshold over a 12-week moving window. Despite significant improvements in the underlying SST datasets, corresponding revisions of the HotSpot threshold and accumulation window are still lacking. Here, we fine-tune the operational DHW algorithm to optimise coral bleaching predictions using the 5 km satellite-based SSTs (CoralTemp v3.1) and a global coral bleaching dataset (37,871 observations, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). After developing 234 test DHW algorithms with different combinations of the HotSpot threshold and accumulation window, we compared their bleaching prediction ability using spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical models and sensitivity–specificity analyses. Peak DHW performance was reached using HotSpot thresholds less than or equal to the maximum of monthly means SST climatology (MMM) and accumulation windows of 4–8 weeks. This new configuration correctly predicted up to an additional 310 bleaching observations globally compared to the operational DHW algorithm, an improved hit rate of 7.9%. Given the detrimental impacts of marine heatwaves across ecosystems, heat stress algorithms could also be fine-tuned for other biological systems, improving scientific accuracy, and enabling ecosystem governance.},

The analysis sought to assess baseline performance and determine the capacity for spatial and temporal extension of the trained CNNs. This is not a data fusion approach and a high-resolution image is only needed to train the CNN. Results show improvement with the deeper network generally achieving better results. For spatial and temporal extension, the deep CNN performed the same or better than the shallow CNN, but at greater computational cost. Results for temporal extension were influenced by change potentiality reducing the performance difference between the shallow and deep CNN. Visual examination revealed sharper images regarding land cover boundaries, linear features, and within-cover textures. The results suggest that spatial enhancement of the Landsat archive is feasible, with optimal performance where CNNs can be trained and applied within the same spatial domain.

  abstract     = {In this study, a multi-linear regression model for potential fishing zone (PFZ) mapping along the Saudi Arabian Red Sea coasts of Yanbu’ al Bahr and Jeddah was developed, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data derived parameters, such as sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). MODIS data was also used to validate the model. The model expanded on previous models by taking seasonal variances in PFZs into account, examining the impact of the summer, winter, monsoon, and inter-monsoon season on the selected oceanographic parameters in order to gain a deeper understanding of fish aggregation patterns. MODIS images were used to effectively extract SSS, SST, and Chl-a data for PFZ mapping. MODIS data were then used to perform multiple linear regression analysis in order to generate SSS, SST, and Chl-a estimates, with the estimates validated against in-situ data obtained from field visits completed at the time of the satellite passes. The proposed model demonstrates high potential for use in the Red Sea region, with a high level of congruence found between mapped PFZ areas and fish catch data (R2 = 0.91). Based on the results of this research, it is suggested that the proposed PFZ model is used to support fisheries in determining high potential fishing zones, allowing large areas of the Red Sea to be utilized over a short period. The proposed PFZ model can contribute significantly to the understanding of seasonal fishing activity and support the efficient, effective, and responsible use of resources within the fishing industry.},

Here we present Reef Cover, a coral reef geomorphic zone classification, developed to support both producers and end-users of global-scale coral reef habitat maps, in a transparent and version-based framework. Scalable classes were created by focusing on attributes that can be observed remotely, but whose membership rules also reflect deep knowledge of reef form and functioning. Bridging the divide between earth observation data and geo-ecological knowledge of reefs, Reef Cover maximises the trade-off between applicability at global scales, and relevance and accuracy at local scales. Two case studies demonstrate application of the Reef Cover classification scheme and its scientific and conservation benefits: 1) detailed mapping of the Cairns Management Region of the Great Barrier Reef to support management and 2) mapping of the Caroline and Mariana Island chains in the Pacific for conservation purposes.},

However, such maps are difficult to generate due to the broad geographic range of coral reefs, the complexities of relating satellite imagery to geomorphic or ecological realities, and other challenges. However, reef extent maps are one of the most commonly used and most valuable data products from the perspective of reef scientists and managers. Here, we used convolutional neural networks to generate a globally consistent coral reef probability map—a probabilistic estimate of the geospatial extent of reef ecosystems—to facilitate scientific, conservation, and management efforts. We combined a global mosaic of high spatial resolution Planet Dove satellite imagery with regional Millennium Coral Reef Mapping Project reef extents to build training, validation, and application datasets. These datasets trained our reef extent prediction model, a neural network with a dense-unet architecture followed by a random forest classifier, which was used to produce a global coral reef probability map. Based on this probability map, we generated a global coral reef extent map from a 60% threshold of reef probability (reef: probability ≥ 60%, non-reef: probability < 60%). Our findings provide a proof-of-concept method for global reef extent estimates using a consistent and readily updateable methodology that leverages modern deep learning approaches to support downstream users. These maps are openly-available through the Allen Coral Atlas.},

The rate of death of colonies of the coral Stylophora pistillata was found to be 4–5 times as great in the polluted area as in a control area. Coral damage in the control area is generally caused by grazing or by extreme low tide, but the cause of coral death in the polluted area was not readily apparent. The growth of algae, both on the damaged corals, and on glass slides placed out in the reef, was greatly stimulated in the polluted area, but it appeared that such algal growth was not the direct cause of coral death. Corals in the polluted area may be under stress because of reduced light intensity, inhibition of calcification by excess phosphate, and increased sediment load. It was found that in the polluted area there was a greater weight of sediment settling on the glass slides for a given weight of algae. But in addition, since algal growth was faster in the polluted area, the sediment load was increased by the sediment trapping capacity of the enhanced algal growth. Thus it is suggested that increased algal growth stimulated by increased nutrient concentrations may be important in greatly increasing the sediment load experienced by corals.},

Heat stress-mediated episodes of mass coral bleaching have led to catastrophic coral mortality globally. Remotely monitoring and forecasting such biotic responses to heat stress is key for effective marine ecosystem management. The Degree Heating Week (DHW) metric, designed to monitor coral bleaching risk, reflects the duration and intensity of heat stress events and is computed by accumulat-ing SST anomalies (HotSpot) relative to a stress threshold over a 12-week moving window. Despite significant improvements in the underlying SST datasets, corresponding revisions of the HotSpot threshold and accumulation window are still lacking. Here, we fine-tune the operational DHW algorithm to optimise coral bleaching predictions using the 5 km satellite-based SSTs (CoralTemp v3.1) and a global coral bleaching dataset (37,871 observations, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). After developing 234 test DHW algorithms with different combinations of the HotSpot threshold and accumulation window, we compared their bleaching prediction ability using spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical models and sensitivity–specificity analyses. Peak DHW performance was reached using HotSpot thresholds less than or equal to the maximum of monthly means SST climatology (MMM) and accumulation windows of 4–8 weeks. This new configuration correctly predicted up to an additional 310 bleaching observations globally compared to the operational DHW algorithm, an improved hit rate of 7.9%. Given the detrimental impacts of marine heatwaves across ecosystems, heat stress algorithms could also be fine-tuned for other biological systems, improving scientific accuracy, and enabling ecosystem governance.},

  abstract     = {Remotely sensed ocean color data are useful for monitoring water quality in coastal environments. However, moderate resolution (hundreds of meters to a few kilometers) satellite data are underutilized in these environments because of frequent data gaps from cloud cover and algorithm complexities in shallow waters. Aggregating satellite data over larger space and time scales is a common method to reduce data gaps and generate a more complete time series, but potentially smooths out the small-scale, episodic changes in water quality that can have ecological influences. By comparing aggregated satellite estimates of Kd(490) with related in-water measurements, we can understand the extent to which aggregation methods are viable for filling gaps while being able to characterize ecologically relevant water quality conditions. In this study, we tested a combination of six spatial and seven temporal scales for aggregating data from the VIIRS instrument at several coral reef locations in Maui, Hawai‘i and Puerto Rico and compared these with in situ measurements of Kd(490) and turbidity. In Maui, we found that the median value of a 5-pixels, 7-days spatiotemporal cube of satellite data yielded a robust result capable of differentiating observations across small space and time domains and had the best correlation among spatiotemporal cubes when compared with in situ Kd(490) across 11 nearshore sites (R2 = 0.84). We also found long-term averages (i.e., chronic condition) of VIIRS data using this aggregation method follow a similar spatial pattern to onshore turbidity measurements along the Maui coast over a three-year period. In Puerto Rico, we found that the median of a 13-pixels, 13-days spatiotemporal cube of satellite data yielded the best overall result with an R2 = 0.54 when compared with in situ Kd(490) measurements for one nearshore site with measurement dates spanning 2016–2019. As spatiotemporal cubes of different dimensions yielded optimum results in the two locations, we recommend local analysis of spatial and temporal optima when applying this technique elsewhere. The use of satellite data and in situ water quality measurements provide complementary information, each enhancing understanding of the issues affecting coastal ecosystems, including coral reefs, and the success of management efforts.},

It has a 5-day revisit time, spatial resolution of 10 m, free data, etc. In this study, Sentinel-2 imagery was investigated for bleaching detection through simulations and a case study over the Lizard Island, Australia. The spectral and image simulations based on the semianalytical (SA) model and the sensor spectral response function, respectively, confirmed that coral bleaching cannot be detected only using one image, and the change analysis was proposed for detection because there will be a featured change signal for bleached corals. Band 2 of Sentinel-2 is superior to its other bands for the overall consideration of signal attenuation and spatial resolution. However, the detection capability of Sentinel-2 is still limited by the water depth. With rapid signal attenuation due to the water absorption effect, the applicable water depth for bleaching detection was recommended to be less than 10 m. The change analysis was conducted using two methods: one radiometric normalization with pseudo invariant features (PIFs) and the other with multi-temporal depth invariant indices (DII). The former performed better than the latter in terms of classification. The bleached corals maps obtained using the PIFs and DII approaches had an overall accuracy of 88.9 and 57.1%, respectively. Compared with the change analysis based on two dated images, the use of a third image that recorded the spectral signals of recovered corals or corals overgrown by algae after bleaching significantly improved the detection accuracy.

Despite recent advances in the field of earth observation, many of these have remained undetected as RTS are highly dynamic, small, and scattered across the remote permafrost region. Here, we assessed the potential strengths and limitations of using deep learning for the automatic segmentation of RTS using PlanetScope satellite imagery, ArcticDEM and auxiliary datasets. We analyzed the transferability and potential for pan- Arctic upscaling and regional cross-validation, with independent training and validation regions, in six different thaw slump-affected regions in Canada and Russia. We further tested state-ofthe- art model architectures (UNet, UNet++, DeepLabv3) and encoder networks to find optimal model configurations for potential upscaling to continental scales. The best deep learning models achieved mixed results from good to very good agreement in four of the six regions (maxIoU: 0.39 to 0.58, Lena River, Horton Delta, Herschel Island, Kolguev Island), while they failed in two regions (Banks Island, Tuktoyaktuk). Of the tested architectures, UNet++ performed the best. The large variance in regional performance highlights the requirement for a sufficient quantity, quality and spatial variability in the training data used for segmenting RTS across diverse permafrost landscapes, in varying environmental conditions. With our highly automated and configurable workflow, we see great potential for the transfer to active RTS clusters (e.g., Peel Plateau) and upscaling to much larger regions.},

While at the scale of a shelf to basin transect, facies clearly arrange by water depth, the relation blurs for depths <40 m, the most vigorous zone of carbonate production. The reason for this change in behaviour is two-fold. Firstly, in shallow water, the intrinsic processes of storm and wave reworking influence the seabed through submarine erosion and sediment redistribution. Secondly, facies diversity tends to be greater in shallow water than deep water because of a greater diversity in grain producers. Remote sensing imagery, field observations and hydrodynamic models for two reef-rimmed shore-attached carbonate platforms in the Red Sea show neither water depth nor energy regime to be reliable indicators of facies type when considered in isolation. Considered together, however, the predictive power of the two variables rises significantly. The results demonstrate it to be an oversimplification to assume a direct link between palaeo-water depth and depositional diversity of subtidal lithofacies, while highlighting the importance of hydrodynamics in directing the accumulation of carbonate sediments in the shallow photic zone. While the size distributions of facies extents in the two focus areas follow power laws, no direct relation between the lateral continuity of the facies belts and water depth or wave height is reported. The work is relevant for the interpretation of metre-scale subtidal carbonate cycles throughout the geological record by demonstrating how caution must be applied when inferring palaeo-water depths from depositional facies.},

Data products were validated from in situ survey methods including underwater calibration targets, depth measurements and millimetre-scale high-dynamic-range gigapixel photogrammetry. Fluid lensing is an experimental technology that uses water-transmitting wavelengths to passively image underwater objects at high-resolution by exploiting time-varying optical lensing events caused by surface waves. Fluid lensing data are captured from low-altitude, cost-effective electric UAVs to achieve multispectral imagery and bathymetry models at the centimetre scale over regional areas. As a passive system, fluid lensing is presently limited by signal-to-noise ratio and water column inherent optical properties to ~10 m depth over visible wavelengths in clear waters. The datasets derived from fluid lensing present the first centimetre-scale images of a reef acquired from above the ocean surface, without wave distortion. The 3D multispectral data distinguish coral, fish and invertebrates in American Samoa, and reveal previously undocumented, morphologically distinct, stromatolite structures in Shark Bay. These findings suggest fluid lensing and multirotor electric drones represent a promising advance in the remote sensing of aquatic environments at the centimetre scale, or ‘reef scale’ relevant to the conservation of reef ecosystems. Pending further development and validation of fluid lensing methods, these technologies present a solution for large-scale 3D surveys of shallow aquatic habitats with centimetre-scale spatial resolution and hourly temporal sampling.

  abstract     = {The use of unoccupied aircraft systems (UASs, also known as drones) in science is growing rapidly. Recent advances in microelectronics and battery technology have resulted in the rapid development of low-cost UASs that are transforming many industries. Drones are poised to revolutionize marine science and conservation, as they provide essentially on-demand remote sensing capabilities at low cost and with reduced human risk. A variety of multirotor, fixed-wing, and transitional UAS platforms are capable of carrying various optical and physical sampling payloads and are being employed in almost every subdiscipline of marine science and conservation. This article provides an overview of the UAS platforms and sensors used in marine science and conservation missions along with example physical, biological, and natural resource management applications and typical analytical workflows. It concludes with details on potential effects of UASs on marine wildlife and a look to the future of UASs in marine science and conservation.},

  abstract     = {Coral reefs are in decline worldwide and monitoring activities are important for assessing the impact of disturbance on reefs and tracking subsequent recovery or decline. Monitoring by field surveys provides accurate data but at highly localised scales and so is not cost-effective for reef scale monitoring at frequent time points. Remote sensing from satellites is an alternative and complementary approach. While remote sensing cannot provide the level of detail and accuracy at a single point than a field survey, the statistical power for inferring large scale patterns benefits in having complete areal coverage. This review considers the state of the art of coral reef remote sensing for the diverse range of objectives relevant for management, ranging from the composition of the reef: physical extent, benthic cover, bathymetry, rugosity; to environmental parameters: sea surface temperature, exposure, light, carbonate chemistry. In addition to updating previous reviews, here we also consider the capability to go beyond basic maps of habitats or environmental variables, to discuss concepts highly relevant to stakeholders, policy makers and public communication: such as biodiversity, environmental threat and ecosystem services. A clear conclusion of the review is that advances in both sensor technology and processing algorithms continue to drive forward remote sensing capability for coral reef mapping, particularly with respect to spatial resolution of maps, and synthesis across multiple data products. Both trends can be expected to continue.},

  abstract     = {Accurate mapping and effective monitoring of benthic habitat in the Florida Keys are critical in developing management strategies for this valuable coral reef ecosystem. For this study, a framework was designed for automated benthic habitat mapping by combining multiple data sources (hyperspectral, aerial photography, and bathymetry data) and four contemporary imagery processing techniques (data fusion, Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA), machine learning, and ensemble analysis). In the framework, 1-m digital aerial photograph was first merged with 17-m hyperspectral imagery and 10-m bathymetry data using a pixel/feature-level fusion strategy. The fused dataset was then preclassified by three machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and k-Nearest Neighbor). Final object-based habitat maps were produced through ensemble analysis of outcomes from three classifiers. The framework was tested for classifying a group-level (3-class) and code-level (9-class) habitats in a portion of the Florida Keys. Informative and accurate habitat maps were achieved with an overall accuracy of 88.5% and 83.5% for the group-level and code-level classifications, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Satellite image classification is a challenging problem that lies at the crossroads of remote sensing, computer vision, and machine learning. Due to the high variability inherent in satellite data, most of the current object classification approaches are not suitable for handling satellite datasets. The progress of satellite image analytics has also been inhibited by the lack of a single labeled highresolution dataset with multiple class labels. The contributions of this paper are twofold - (1) first, we present two new satellite datasets called SAT-4 and SAT-6, and (2) then, we propose a classification framework that extracts features from an input image, normalizes them and feeds the normalized feature vectors to a Deep Belief Network for classification. On the SAT-4 dataset, our best network produces a classification accuracy of 97.95% and outperforms three state-of-the-art object recognition algorithms, namely - Deep Belief Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks and Stacked Denoising Autoencoders by ∼11%. On SAT-6, it produces a classification accuracy of 93.9% and outperforms the other algorithms by ∼15%. Comparative studies with a Random Forest classifier show the advantage of an unsupervised learning approach over traditional supervised learning techniques. A statistical analysis based on Distribution Separability Criterion and Intrinsic Dimensionality Estimation substantiates the effectiveness of our approach in learning better representations for satellite imagery.},

Established under the Australian Government’s National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy to provide trusted biodiversity data to support the research sector, its utility now extends to government, higher education, non-government organisations and community groups. These partners provide data to the ALA and leverage its data and related services. The ALA has also played an important leadership role internationally in the biodiversity informatics and infrastructure space, both through its partnership with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and through support for the international Living Atlases programmes which has now delivered 24 instances of ALA software to deliver sovereign biodiversity data capability around the world. This paper begins with a historical overview of the genesis of the ALA from the collections, museums and herbaria community in Australia. It details the biodiversity and related data and services delivered to users with a primary focus on species occurrence records which represent the ALA's primary data type. Finally, the paper explores the ALA's future directions by referencing results from a recently completed national consultation process.},
