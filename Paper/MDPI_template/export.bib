  abstract = {Tourism is a leading economic activity in most nations across the world. The tourism industry accounts for about 5\% of the global gross domestic product (GDP) and gives rise to about 8\% total world employment. As the number of international tourist arrivals keep increasing, the tourism industry has become a top foreign earner in both developed and developing nations. Based upon this development, countries such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), which were not known for tourism investment before, have started to make much investment in the sector in order to diversify their economy from being a single oil-based economy. KSA as a virgin and undiscovered country can capitalize on tourism to earn more income. This paper strives to provide a synthesis overview of the KSA tourism sector in relation to novel tourism initiatives that are anchored on the country's vision 2030. In order to achieve its goals, this article analyzed available material on topics discussing tourism associated with KSA tourism activities and initiatives. Information available in the literature and various secondary sources (i.e., newspaper articles, government publications, articles, and books) helped the researcher to understand the progress KSA has made in efforts to improve tourism activities. The review revealed that the political will of KSA has taken major steps to integrate and compliment tourism as an alternative source of income (i.e., launching of tourism Visas by the end of 2019). Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman is making moves to attract tourists to the country by softening some of the infamous and strict rules that existed in KSA. Moreover, the KSA Vision 2030 has plans to reduce the nation's dependence on oil, with tourism being a significant aspect of this transformation. Thus, Saudi Arabia will open-up tourism on a selected basis. The transformation of KSA will have some ramifications across the globe. KSA is undergoing a radical shift in political and economic spheres that might destabilize the entire Middle East region. Shifting from an oil dependent economy to a more tourism driven economy is likely to send shock waves among the KSA's neighbours.},

  abstract = {The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) covers an area of more than 2.24 million km2, and overlooks coasts for more than 2,500 linear kilometres along the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf. Its mainland is subdivided into thirteen regions which vary in their geomorphological and socio-cultural features. Such a spatial extent represents varieties of natural ecosystems; the most vulnerable and important ones were exemplified in sixteen protected areas which cover about 4.5\% of the total area of the country. The diversification of natural habitats and ecosystems extends from deep seas through coastal plains to plateaus and harsh deserts. The strategic movement toward promotion of the tourism industry in all regions of the KSA began in 2002 and has attracted huge investments in this newly growing sector as well as a change in tourists' attitudes. Most of the investments seek short-time profit, thus environmental issues and regional sociocultural differences are less considered in planning of most of the touristic projects. Planning of ecotourism potentialities in the KSA requires holistic integration of both biocentic (nature-centred) and anthropocentric (human-centred) perspectives to maintain sustainable ecotourism at the national level, which is the function of environment, economy and equity (or justice). Therefore, the aim of this paper is to promote sustainable ecotourism in the KSA through exploration of major natural potentialities and their opportunities for different types of ecotourism. It also tries to draw several planning and management guidelines in order to ensure acceptable environmental qualities and the sustainable use of the resources within their natural ecosystems. © 2010 WIT Press.},

For the period of available TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) satellite altimetry data (1993-2003), the linear trend of thermosteric sea level (0-700 m) is 1.23 mm/year, 60\% of which is due to the trends in the Pacific Ocean. For the 0-3000 m layer of the entire World Ocean, the linear trend of thermosteric sea level is 0.40 mm/year for 1955-1959 through 1994-1998. For the 50°S-65°N region that we previously reported (Antonov et al., 2002) which was characterized by a 0.50 mm/year trend for 1955-1959 through 1992-1996, our new estimate is 0.47 mm/year for this same period.

  abstract = {Since the early 1980s, episodes of coral reef bleaching and mortality, due primarily to climate-induced ocean warming, have occurred almost annually in one or more of the world's tropical or subtropical seas. Bleaching is episodic, with the most severe events typically accompanying coupled ocean–atmosphere phenomena, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which result in sustained regional elevations of ocean temperature. Using this extended dataset (25+ years), we review the short- and long-term ecological impacts of coral bleaching on reef ecosystems, and quantitatively synthesize recovery data worldwide. Bleaching episodes have resulted in catastrophic loss of coral cover in some locations, and have changed coral community structure in many others, with a potentially critical influence on the maintenance of biodiversity in the marine tropics. Bleaching has also set the stage for other declines in reef health, such as increases in coral diseases, the breakdown of reef framework by bioeroders, and the loss of critical habitat for associated reef fishes and other biota. Secondary ecological effects, such as the concentration of predators on remnant surviving coral populations, have also accelerated the pace of decline in some areas. Although bleaching severity and recovery have been variable across all spatial scales, some reefs have experienced relatively rapid recovery from severe bleaching impacts. There has been a significant overall recovery of coral cover in the Indian Ocean, where many reefs were devastated by a single large bleaching event in 1998. In contrast, coral cover on western Atlantic reefs has generally continued to decline in response to multiple smaller bleaching events and a diverse set of chronic secondary stressors. No clear trends are apparent in the eastern Pacific, the central-southern-western Pacific or the Arabian Gulf, where some reefs are recovering and others are not. The majority of survivors and new recruits on regenerating and recovering coral reefs have originated from broadcast spawning taxa with a potential for asexual growth, relatively long distance dispersal, successful settlement, rapid growth and a capacity for framework construction. Whether or not affected reefs can continue to function as before will depend on: (1) how much coral cover is lost, and which species are locally extirpated; (2) the ability of remnant and recovering coral communities to adapt or acclimatize to higher temperatures and other climatic factors such as reductions in aragonite saturation state; (3) the changing balance between reef accumulation and bioerosion; and (4) our ability to maintain ecosystem resilience by restoring healthy levels of herbivory, macroalgal cover, and coral recruitment. Bleaching disturbances are likely to become a chronic stress in many reef areas in the coming decades, and coral communities, if they cannot recover quickly enough, are likely to be reduced to their most hardy or adaptable constituents. Some degraded reefs may already be approaching this ecological asymptote, although to date there have not been any global extinctions of individual coral species as a result of bleaching events. Since human populations inhabiting tropical coastal areas derive great value from coral reefs, the degradation of these ecosystems as a result of coral bleaching and its associated impacts is of considerable societal, as well as biological concern. Coral reef conservation strategies now recognize climate change as a principal threat, and are engaged in efforts to allocate conservation activity according to geographic-, taxonomic-, and habitat-specific priorities to maximize coral reef survival. Efforts to forecast and monitor bleaching, involving both remote sensed observations and coupled ocean–atmosphere climate models, are also underway. In addition to these efforts, attempts to minimize and mitigate bleaching impacts on reefs are immediately required. If significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved within the next two to three decades, maximizing coral survivorship during this time may be critical to ensuring healthy reefs can recover in the long term.},

  abstract = {Satellite image classification is a challenging problem that lies at the crossroads of remote sensing, computer vision, and machine learning. Due to the high variability inherent in satellite data, most of the current object classification approaches are not suitable for handling satellite datasets. The progress of satellite image analytics has also been inhibited by the lack of a single labeled highresolution dataset with multiple class labels. The contributions of this paper are twofold - (1) first, we present two new satellite datasets called SAT-4 and SAT-6, and (2) then, we propose a classification framework that extracts features from an input image, normalizes them and feeds the normalized feature vectors to a Deep Belief Network for classification. On the SAT-4 dataset, our best network produces a classification accuracy of 97.95\% and outperforms three state-of-the-art object recognition algorithms, namely - Deep Belief Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks and Stacked Denoising Autoencoders by ∼11\%. On SAT-6, it produces a classification accuracy of 93.9\% and outperforms the other algorithms by ∼15\%. Comparative studies with a Random Forest classifier show the advantage of an unsupervised learning approach over traditional supervised learning techniques. A statistical analysis based on Distribution Separability Criterion and Intrinsic Dimensionality Estimation substantiates the effectiveness of our approach in learning better representations for satellite imagery.},

  abstract = {The worldwide decline of coral reefs calls for an urgent reassessment of current management practices. Confronting large-scale crises requires a major scaling-up of management efforts based on an improved understanding of the ecological processes that underlie reef resilience. Managing for improved resilience, incorporating the role of human activity in shaping ecosystems, provides a basis for coping with uncertainty, future changes and ecological surprises. Here we review the ecological roles of critical functional groups (for both corals and reef fishes) that are fundamental to understanding resilience and avoiding phase shifts from coral dominance to less desirable, degraded ecosystems. We identify striking biogeographic differences in the species richness and composition of functional groups, which highlight the vulnerability of Caribbean reef ecosystems. These findings have profound implications for restoration of degraded reefs, management of fisheries, and the focus on marine protected areas and biodiversity hotspots as priorities for conservation. T he overall goal of coral reef management is to sustain the ability of tropical reefs to provide the ecosystem goods and services (for example, fisheries, tourism, aesthetic and cultural values), upon which human welfare depends 1. Although there have been some local successes, current management of reefs has failed to achieve this goal at a regional or global scale. Instead, coral reefs worldwide are in serious decline, owing primarily to over-harvesting 2,3 , pollution 4,5 , disease 6 and climate change 7-9. Even the Great Barrier Reef, widely regarded as one of the most 'pristine' coral reefs in the world, shows system-wide decline (Fig. 1). In many locations around the world, man-made stresses to coral reefs have exceeded their regenerative capacity, causing dramatic shifts in species composition and resulting in severe economic loss. In a changing world, one must expect and learn to manage uncertainty 10. In this review, we argue that the acceleration of human impacts on reef ecosystems requires a radical reassessment of the way these important marine resources are monitored and managed. We propose that the resilience of reef ecosystems-that is, their ability to absorb shocks, resist phase shifts and regenerate after natural and human-induced disturbances 11-needs to be more directly assessed and actively managed. Achieving this outcome requires an improved understanding of the dynamics of coral reef ecosystems, of the processes that support or undermine resilience, and of the socioeconomic drivers and governance systems that regulate water quality and rates of extraction of reef resources. Here, we begin this reassessment by focusing on one important aspect of resilience, the role of critical functional groups 12,13. In this context, we document profound temporal and geographic variation in the ability of coral reefs to cope with accelerating human impacts. Loss of resilience Coral reefs, by definition, are three-dimensional shallow-water structures dominated by scleractinian corals. In the absence of severe human impacts, reefs readily reassemble after routine disturbances such as tropical hurricanes 14. However, many contemporary coral reefs increasingly fail to regenerate after natural and human impacts, and instead have undergone a rapid shift to an alternate state 15-18. The most familiar of these transitions is from dominance by corals to dominance by fleshy seaweed, although several other transitions have been documented (Fig. 2). The extent to which alternate states are stable or reversible is poorly understood 19 and represents a major challenge for research and management of reefs. Until now there has been little success in predicting such regime or phase shifts, because the increased instability of coral reef ecosystems before their collapse has often been unrecognized, even on reefs that are relatively well studied. This cryptic loss of coral reef resilience can be manifested in numerous ways. For example, the collapse of many Caribbean coral reefs was long preceded by dwindling stocks of fishes and increased nutrient and sediment runoff from land 2,16. By the 1950s, when modern studies of reef ecology began, the prevention of macroalgal blooms was increasingly due to a single species of sea urchin, Diadema antil-larum. In the 1970s, recorded densities of Diadema on overfished reefs were extraordinarily high, averaging more than ten individuals per square metre in shallow waters 20-23. The magnitude and crowded conditions of Diadema populations 24 may have contrib-Figure 1 Degradation of coral reefs. a, Results of a meta-analysis of the literature, showing a decline in coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef.

Recently, corals harbouring Symbiodinium thermophilum, a thermotolerant microalgae, were found to be prevalent among UAE reefs and were reported to endure extreme sea-surface temperatures. Late 2015–early 2016 was marked with the strongest El Niño on record worldwide, which caused massive coral bleaching (loss of symbiotic microalgae from reef-building corals). In September 2015, the waters flanking UAE coasts were identified to be among the areas facing a thermal stress reaching its highest level liable to cause massive coral bleaching. However, the effect of this thermal stress on UAE corals remained largely unknown. Here, multi-temporal DubaiSat-2 satellite images were used to show that changes in the reef environment of Dalma Island, UAE, between 2014 and 2016, occurred in macroalgae-dominant habitats, whereas live corals remained unaltered. Furthermore, extending the study to a larger area helped in discovering a continuum of live and pristine corals, which was not reported or studied before. While sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1°C were reported to significantly damage coral reefs around the world, the live coral habitat was observed to exhibit no-change despite four consecutive months of +2°C to 3°C anomalies reported during the study period. These findings point to the tolerance of UAE live corals faced with extreme climate conditions.},

This threshold is presented as a dose-time response for a salinity-sensitive range of 22-28 PSU and an exposure time of 3-16 days at the lowest and highest salinities, respectively.

Three catastrophic rises were synchronous with 1) collapse of the Laurentide and Antarctic ice sheets, 2) dramatic reorganization of ocean-atmosphere circulation, and 3) releases of huge volumes of subglacial and proglacial meltwater. This correlation suggests that release of stored meltwater periodically destabilized ice sheets, causing them to collapse and send huge fleets of icebergs into the Atlantic. Massive inputs of ice not only produced catastrophic sea-level rise, drowning reefs and destablizing other ice sheets, but also rapidly reduced the elevation of the Laurentide ice sheet, flipping atmospheric circulation patterns and forcing warm equatorial waters into the frigid North Atlantic. Such dramatic evidence of catastrophic climate and sea-level change during deglaciation has potentially disastrous implications for the future, especially as the stability of remaining ice sheets - such as in West Antarctica - is in question. -Authors}

  abstract = {The Saudi Arabian Red Sea (SARS) contains diverse shallow water coral reef systems that include attached (fringing and dendritic reefs) and detached (platform, patch, tower, ribbon, and barrier reefs) reef systems extending up to 90 km offshore. To better understand the current status of coral reefs in SARS, the Living Oceans Foundation conducted assessments of representative reef environments in the Farasan Islands (2006), Ras Al-Qasabah (2007), Al Wajh and Yanbu (2008), and the Farasan Banks (2009). A combination of belt transects and quadrats was used to assess the diversity, size structure, partial mortality, condition, and recruitment of the dominant reef-building corals. Most sites had high structural complexity, with up to 52 genera of scleractinian corals recorded from a single region. Living corals varied in abundance and cover by region, habitat, and depth, with the highest species richness documented in the south (Farasan Banks), followed by Al Wajh and Yanbu and lowest at Ras Al-Qasabah. On most reefs, a single species was dominant. The reef architecture was constructed by massive and columnar Porites, with unusually large (1–4 m diameter) colonies in shallow water (up to 80 \% live cover in 2–10 m depth) and a deeper reef Porites framework that was mostly dead. Porites lutea was the single most abundant coral throughout SARS, and the dominant species on leeward reef crests and slopes, while reef slopes and deeper coral carpets were predominantly Porites columnaris and P. rus. Faviids (Goniastrea and Echinopora) were the next most abundant corals, especially in areas that had experienced a disturbance, although these were small (most {$<$}15 cm diameter) and made up a small fraction of the total live coral cover. Multi-specific Acropora assemblages often formed large thickets, but these were restricted in distribution. Pocillopora was the dominant taxon in Yanbu, widespread in Al Wajh, and much less common in northern and southern sites. Coral cover throughout the region averaged about 20 \%, with higher cover (often {$>$}50 \%) in shallow water and rapid decline with increasing depth. In each region, many reefs (15–36 \%) showed signs of damage and had less than 5 \% live coral cover. These degraded sites were characterized by extensive dead skeletons in growth position, substrates colonized by thick mats of turf algae and soft corals (Xenia), and surviving massive and plating corals that were subdivided by partial mortality into numerous small ({$<$}10 cm) ramets. Mortality was attributed to bleaching events, disease, and outbreaks of corallivores occurring over the last 10–15 years. Several sites also exhibited signs of recent mortality from crown of thorns sea stars (Acanthaster), coral- eating snails, and coral disease. In many cases, the Porites framework had been recolonized by faviids, acroporids, and other corals and these had subsequently died. Most degraded areas appeared to be rebounding, as substrates had high cover of crustose coralline algae (CCA), little macroalgae, and high numbers of coral recruits and juvenile corals.},

Those data are used for different applications, such as natural hazard monitoring, global climate change, urban planning, etc. The applications are data driven and mostly interdisciplinary. Based on this it can truly be stated that we are now living in the age of big remote sensing data. Furthermore, these data are becoming an economic asset and a new important resource in many applications. In this paper, we specifically analyze the challenges and opportunities that big data bring in the context of remote sensing applications. Our focus is to analyze what exactly does big data mean in remote sensing applications and how can big data provide added value in this context. Furthermore, this paper describes the most challenging issues in managing, processing, and efficient exploitation of big data for remote sensing problems. In order to illustrate the aforementioned aspects, two case studies discussing the use of big data in remote sensing are demonstrated. In the first test case, big data are used to automatically detect marine oil spills using a large archive of remote sensing data. In the second test case, content-based information retrieval is performed using high-performance computing (HPC) to extract information from a large database of remote sensing images, collected after the terrorist attack to the World Trade Center in New York City. Both cases are used to illustrate the significant challenges and opportunities brought by the use of big data in remote sensing applications.},

  abstract = {The use of fluid lensing technology on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) is presented as a novel means for 3D imaging of aquatic ecosystems from above the water's surface at the centimetre scale. Preliminary results are presented from airborne fluid lensing campaigns conducted over the coral reefs of Ofu Island, American Samoa (2013) and the stromatolite reefs of Shark Bay, Western Australia (2014), covering a combined area of 15 km2. These reef ecosystems were revealed with centimetre-scale 2D resolution, and an accompanying 3D bathymetry model was derived using fluid lensing, Structure from Motion and UAV position data. Data products were validated from in situ survey methods including underwater calibration targets, depth measurements and millimetre-scale high-dynamic-range gigapixel photogrammetry. Fluid lensing is an experimental technology that uses water-transmitting wavelengths to passively image underwater objects at high-resolution by exploiting time-varying optical lensing events caused by surface waves. Fluid lensing data are captured from low-altitude, cost-effective electric UAVs to achieve multispectral imagery and bathymetry models at the centimetre scale over regional areas. As a passive system, fluid lensing is presently limited by signal-to-noise ratio and water column inherent optical properties to \textasciitilde 10 m depth over visible wavelengths in clear waters. The datasets derived from fluid lensing present the first centimetre-scale images of a reef acquired from above the ocean surface, without wave distortion. The 3D multispectral data distinguish coral, fish and invertebrates in American Samoa, and reveal previously undocumented, morphologically distinct, stromatolite structures in Shark Bay. These findings suggest fluid lensing and multirotor electric drones represent a promising advance in the remote sensing of aquatic environments at the centimetre scale, or ‘reef scale’ relevant to the conservation of reef ecosystems. Pending further development and validation of fluid lensing methods, these technologies present a solution for large-scale 3D surveys of shallow aquatic habitats with centimetre-scale spatial resolution and hourly temporal sampling.

  abstract = {Impacts of global climate change on coral reefs are being amplified by pulse heat stress events, including El Niño, the warm phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Despite reports of extensive coral bleaching and up to 97\% coral mortality induced by El Niño events, a quantitative synthesis of the nature, intensity, and drivers of El Niño and La Niña impacts on corals is lacking. Herein, we first present a global meta-analysis of studies quantifying the effects of El Niño/La Niña-warming on corals, surveying studies from both the primary literature and International Coral Reef Symposium (ICRS) Proceedings. Overall, the strongest signal for El Niño/La Niña-associated coral bleaching was long-term mean temperature; bleaching decreased with decreasing long-term mean temperature (n = 20 studies). Additionally, coral cover losses during El Niño/La Niña were shaped by localized maximum heat stress and long-term mean temperature (n = 28 studies). Second, we present a method for quantifying coral heat stress which, for any coral reef location in the world, allows extraction of remotely-sensed degree heating weeks (DHW) for any date (since 1982), quantification of the maximum DHW, and the time lag since the maximum DHW. Using this method, we show that the 2015/16 El Niño event instigated unprecedented global coral heat stress across the world’s oceans. With El Niño events expected to increase in frequency and severity this century, it is imperative that we gain a clear understanding of how these thermal stress anomalies impact different coral species and coral reef regions. We therefore finish with recommendations for future coral bleaching studies that will foster improved syntheses, as well as predictive and adaptive capacity to extreme warming events.},

  abstract = {The worldwide waning health of coral reefs implies an increasing need for monitoring them at colony scale over large areas. Relaying fieldwork considerably, the remote sensing approach can address this need in offering spectral information relevant for coral health detection with 0.5 m spatial accuracy. We investigated the potential of spectral diversity indices to achieve the discrimination of coral-dominated assemblages and health states from novel satellite imagery (WorldView-2, WV2). Both Equitability’s (E) and Pielou’s (P) operators were used to quantify the evenness of the corrected visible spectral bands (two times 26 combinations of five bands) corresponding to remotely sensed colonies. Three scleractinian corals (Porites lobata, P. rus and Acropora pulchra) that are primarily involved in Moorea’s reef building (French Polynesia) were examined in respect to their health state (healthy or unhealthy, referring to both bleached and dead coral, hereinafter). Using four classifiers, we showed that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) greatly discerned among the six coral classes based upon the five WV2 spectral bands (93\%), thus surpassing the classification issued from the three traditionally used bands (80\%). Coupling the WV2 dataset with Egreen-red, Eyellow-red or E“coastal”-blue-green allowed the SVM performance to attain 96\%. On the other hand, adding the E“coastal”-blue to the WV2-dataset contributed to a substantially increase of the classification accuracy derived from the Random Forest classifier, stepping from 64\% to 77\%. Significant contributions of spectral diversity indices to surveying coral health were further discussed in the light of spectral properties of coral-related pigments. These findings may play a major role for the extensive monitoring of coral health states at a fine scale, and for the management and restoration of damaged coral reefs.}

As yet, it is not clear whether this resilience is related to the presence of specific symbiont types that are exclusively found in this region. Therefore, we used molecular markers to identify the symbiotic algae of three Porites species along {$>$}1000 km of coastline in the PAG and the Gulf of Oman and found that a recently described species, Symbiodinium thermophilum, is integral to coral survival in the southern PAG, the world's hottest sea. Despite the geographic isolation of the PAG, we discovered that representatives of the S. thermophilum group can also be found in the adjacent Gulf of Oman providing a potential source of thermotolerant symbionts that might facilitate the adaptation of Indian Ocean populations to the higher water temperatures expected for the future. However, corals from the PAG associated with S. thermophilum show strong local adaptation not only to high temperatures but also to the exceptionally high salinity of their habitat. We show that their superior heat tolerance can be lost when these corals are exposed to reduced salinity levels common for oceanic environments elsewhere. Consequently, the salinity prevailing in most reefs outside the PAG might represent a distribution barrier for extreme temperature-tolerant coral/Symbiodinium associations from the PAG.},

MODIS data was also used to validate the model. The model expanded on previous models by taking seasonal variances in PFZs into account, examining the impact of the summer, winter, monsoon, and inter-monsoon season on the selected oceanographic parameters in order to gain a deeper understanding of fish aggregation patterns. MODIS images were used to effectively extract SSS, SST, and Chl-a data for PFZ mapping. MODIS data were then used to perform multiple linear regression analysis in order to generate SSS, SST, and Chl-a estimates, with the estimates validated against in-situ data obtained from field visits completed at the time of the satellite passes. The proposed model demonstrates high potential for use in the Red Sea region, with a high level of congruence found between mapped PFZ areas and fish catch data (R2 = 0.91). Based on the results of this research, it is suggested that the proposed PFZ model is used to support fisheries in determining high potential fishing zones, allowing large areas of the Red Sea to be utilized over a short period. The proposed PFZ model can contribute significantly to the understanding of seasonal fishing activity and support the efficient, effective, and responsible use of resources within the fishing industry.},

  abstract = {Coral reef maps at various spatial scales and extents are needed for mapping, monitoring, modelling, and management of these environments. High spatial resolution satellite imagery, pixel {$<$}10 m, integrated with field survey data and processed with various mapping approaches, can provide these maps. These approaches have been accurately applied to single reefs (10-100 km2), covering one high spatial resolution scene from which a single thematic layer (e.g. benthic community) is mapped. This article demonstrates how a hierarchical mapping approach can be applied to coral reefs from individual reef to reef-system scales (10-1000 km2) using object-based image classification of high spatial resolution images guided by ecological and geomorphological principles. The approach is demonstrated for three individual reefs (10-35 km2) in Australia, Fiji, and Palau; and for three complex reef systems (300-600 km2) one in the Solomon Islands and two in Fiji. Archived high spatial resolution images were pre-processed and mosaics were created for the reef systems. Georeferenced benthic photo transect surveys were used to acquire cover information. Field and image data were integrated using an object-based image analysis approach that resulted in a hierarchically structured classification. Objects were assigned class labels based on the dominant benthic cover type, or location-relevant ecological and geomorphological principles, or a combination thereof. This generated a hierarchical sequence of reef maps with an increasing complexity in benthic thematic information that included: 'reef', 'reef type', 'geomorphic zone', and 'benthic community'. The overall accuracy of the 'geomorphic zone' classification for each of the six study sites was 76-82\% using 6-10 mapping categories. For 'benthic community' classification, the overall accuracy was 52-75\% with individual reefs having 14-17 categories and reef systems 20-30 categories. We show that an object-based classification of high spatial resolution imagery, guided by field data and ecological and geomorphological principles, can produce consistent, accurate benthic maps at four hierarchical spatial scales for coral reefs of various sizes and complexities. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.}

The responses of each of these groups are evaluated separately against the four main water quality parameters: (1) increased dissolved inorganic nutrients, (2) enrichment with particulate organic matter, (3) light reduction from turbidity and (4) increased sedimentation. This separation facilitates disentangling and understanding the mechanisms leading to changes in the field, where many contaminants and many responses co-occur. The review also summarises geographic and biological factors that determine local and regional levels of resistance and resilience to degradation.

  abstract = {The Red Sea is a unique body of water, hosting some of the most productive and diverse coral reefs. Human populations along coasts of the Red Sea were initially sparse due to the hot and arid climate surrounding it, but this is changing with improved desalination techniques, accessible energy, and increased economic interest in coastal areas. In addition to increasing pressure on reefs from coastal development, global drivers, primarily ocean acidification and seawater warming, are threatening coral reefs of the region. While reefs in southern sections of the Red Sea live near or above their maximum temperature tolerance and have experienced bleaching events in the recent past, coral reefs in northern sections are considered a coral reef refugia from global warming and acidification, at least for the coming decades. Such differential sensitivities along the latitudinal gradient of the Red Sea require differential solutions and management. In an effort to identify the appropriate solutions to conserve and maintain resilience of these reefs along a latitudinal gradient, we used a SWOT analysis (strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats) to frame the present situation and to propose policy solutions as useful planning procedures. We highlight the need for immediate action to secure the northern sections of the Red Sea as a coral reef climate change refuge by management and removal of local stressors. There is a need to strengthen the scientific knowledge base for proper management and to encourage regional collaboration on environmental issues. Based on scientific data, solutions such as marine protected areas, fishing regulation, and reef restoration approaches were ranked for five distinct latitudinal sections in the Red Sea and levels of interventions are recommended.},

  abstract = {Healthy coral reefs play a vital role in maintaining biodiversity in tropical marine ecosystems. Deep sea exploration and imaging have provided us with a great opportunity to look into the vast and complex marine ecosystems. Data acquisition from the coral reefs has facilitated the scientific investigation of these intricate ecosystems. Millions of digital images of the sea floor have been collected with the help of Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Automated technology to monitor the health of the oceans allows for transformational ecological outcomes by standardizing methods for detecting and identifying species. Manual annotation is a tediously repetitive and a time consuming task for marine experts. It takes 10-30 minutes for a marine expert to meticulously annotate a single image. This paper aims to automate the analysis of large available AUV imagery by developing advanced deep learning tools for rapid and large-scale automatic annotation of marine coral species. Such an automated technology would greatly benefit marine ecological studies in terms of cost, speed, accuracy and thus in better quantifying the level of environmental change marine ecosystems can tolerate. We propose a deep learning based classification method for coral reefs. We also report the application of the proposed technique towards the automatic annotation of unlabelled mosaics of the coral reef in the Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia. Our proposed method automatically quantifies the coral coverage in this region and detects a decreasing trend in coral population which is in line with conclusions by marine ecologists.},

  abstract = {'It should be clear that the upper temperature limit for life cannot be accurately defined' (Schmidt-Nielsen 1996). The thermal physiology of zooxanthellate reef corals is reviewed in this paper in the context of organismal and biochemical responses occurring during coral bleaching, with emphasis on methods of detection and interpretation of animal and algal symbiont stress. Coral bleaching, as presently defined in the literature, is a highly subjective term used to describe a variety of conditions pertaining to low symbiont densities in the coral-algal complex, including response to thermal stress. Three general types of high-temperature bleaching are defined: physiological bleaching, which may or may not include higher-than-normal temperature responses; algal-stress bleaching, involving dysfunction of symbiotic algae at high light and/or high temperatures; and animal-stress bleaching, where coral cells containing symbiotic algae are shed from the gastrodermal layer of cells. Since none of these methods of bleaching is mutually exclusive, a combination of intrusive and non-intrusive techniques is necessary to determine which mechanisms of symbiont loss are occurring. While quantification of symbiont densities, algal pigments, and coral tissue biomass provide unambiguous evidence of bleaching severity, measurements of physiological and biochemical degradation offer additional correlative evidence of temperature stress. Pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometry has emerged as an easy and relatively inexpensive non-invasive technique for monitoring symbiotic algal function both in situ and in the laboratory, when proper assumptions and interpretations are made. The roles of global warming, water quality, acclimation/adaptation processes, and relation to coral disease and reef heterogeneity are also discussed. A thorough understanding of the organismal responses occurring during bleaching will help explain changes in coral populations and in the coral reef community, and perhaps assist in predicting the future of reef corals and coral reefs during the next century of global climate change.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral remote sensing inversion models utilize spectral information over optically shallow waters to retrieve optical properties of the water column, bottom depth and reflectance, with the latter used in benthic classification. Accuracy of these retrievals is dependent on the spectral endmember(s) used to model the bottom reflectance during the inversion. Without prior knowledge of these endmember(s) current approaches must iterate through a list of endmember—a computationally demanding task. To address this, a novel lookup table classification approach termed HOPE-LUT was developed for selecting the likely benthic endmembers of any hyperspectral image pixel. HOPE-LUT classifies a pixel as sand, mixture or non-sand, then the latter two are resolved into the three most likely classes. Optimization subsequently selects the class (out of the three) that generated the best fit to the remote sensing reflectance. For a coral reef case, modeling results indicate very high benthic classification accuracy ({$>$}90\%) for depths less than 4 m of common coral reef benthos. These accuracies decrease substantially with increasing depth due to the loss of bottom information, especially the spectral signatures. We applied this technique to hyperspectral airborne imagery of Heron Reef, Great Barrier Reef and generated benthic habitat maps with higher classification accuracy compared to standard inversion models.},

  abstract = {Remotely sensed ocean color data are useful for monitoring water quality in coastal environments. However, moderate resolution (hundreds of meters to a few kilometers) satellite data are underutilized in these environments because of frequent data gaps from cloud cover and algorithm complexities in shallow waters. Aggregating satellite data over larger space and time scales is a common method to reduce data gaps and generate a more complete time series, but potentially smooths out the small-scale, episodic changes in water quality that can have ecological influences. By comparing aggregated satellite estimates of Kd(490) with related in-water measurements, we can understand the extent to which aggregation methods are viable for filling gaps while being able to characterize ecologically relevant water quality conditions. In this study, we tested a combination of six spatial and seven temporal scales for aggregating data from the VIIRS instrument at several coral reef locations in Maui, Hawai‘i and Puerto Rico and compared these with in situ measurements of Kd(490) and turbidity. In Maui, we found that the median value of a 5-pixels, 7-days spatiotemporal cube of satellite data yielded a robust result capable of differentiating observations across small space and time domains and had the best correlation among spatiotemporal cubes when compared with in situ Kd(490) across 11 nearshore sites (R2 = 0.84). We also found long-term averages (i.e., chronic condition) of VIIRS data using this aggregation method follow a similar spatial pattern to onshore turbidity measurements along the Maui coast over a three-year period. In Puerto Rico, we found that the median of a 13-pixels, 13-days spatiotemporal cube of satellite data yielded the best overall result with an R2 = 0.54 when compared with in situ Kd(490) measurements for one nearshore site with measurement dates spanning 2016–2019. As spatiotemporal cubes of different dimensions yielded optimum results in the two locations, we recommend local analysis of spatial and temporal optima when applying this technique elsewhere. The use of satellite data and in situ water quality measurements provide complementary information, each enhancing understanding of the issues affecting coastal ecosystems, including coral reefs, and the success of management efforts.},

  abstract = {Coral reef bleaching, the whitening of diverse invertebrate taxa, results from the loss of symbiotic zoo-xanthellae and/or a reduction in photosynthetic pigment concentrations in zooxanthellae residing within the gas-trodermal tissues of host animals. Of particular concern are the consequences of bleaching of large numbers of reef-building scleractinian corals and hydrocorals. Published records of coral reef bleaching events from 1870 to the present suggest that the frequency (60 major events from 1979 to 1990), scale (co-occurrence in many coral reef regions and often over the bathymetric depth range of corals) and severity ({$>$} 95\% mortality in some areas) of recent bleaching disturbances are unprecedented in the scientific literature. The causes of small scale, isolated bleaching events can often be explained by particular stressors (e.g., temperature, salinity, light, sedimentation, aerial exposure and pollutants), but attempts to explain large scale bleaching events in terms of possible global change (e.g., greenhouse warming, increased UV radiation flux, deteriorating ecosystem health, or some combination of the above) have not been convincing. Attempts to relate the severity and extent of large scale coral reef bleaching events to particular causes have been hampered by a lack of (a) standardized methods to assess bleaching and (b) continuous, long-term data bases of environmental conditions over the periods of interest. An effort must be made to understand the impact of bleaching on the remainder of the reef community and the long-term effects on competition, predation, symbioses, bioerosion and substrate condition, all factors that can influence coral recruitment and reef recovery. If projected rates of sea warming are realized by mid to late AD 2000, i.e. a 2 \textasciitilde{} C increase in high latitude coral seas, the upper thermal tolerance limits of many reef-building corals could be exceeded. Present evidence suggests that many corals would be unable to adapt physiologically or genetically to such marked and rapid temperature increases .},

  abstract = {Accidental oil discharges pose acute and chronic risks on coral communities, but knowledge on the ecological long-term implications is fragmentary. Here, we examine the potential short-, mid-, and long-term effects of a major oil spill on subtidal reef communities over a 30-year period using a multicontrol before-after-control-impact (BACI) approach. In April 1986, 8000~t (\textasciitilde{} 9.3 106~L) of crude oil were released from a refinery in Bahia Las Minas (Caribbean Panama) contaminating an area of about 40~km2 consisting of intertidal and subtidal mangrove, seagrass, sandy, and coral reef habitats. Surveys of oiled and unpolluted control sites have been conducted at different times between 1985 and 2017 and changes in community metrics (i.e., percent live cover, diversity, community composition, and recruitment) were compared with pre-spill data. The main focus was on scleractinian corals, but impacts on other major benthic taxa were also considered. Short-term oil effects on scleractinian corals included substantial declines in live cover, and diversity as well as changes in community structure being detectable up to 4~years after the spill, while other benthic taxa were hardly affected. Branching corals, such as Acropora palmata, seemed to suffer more, but strong incident-related declines could also be seen in two massive species (i.e., Pseudodiploria clivosa and Porites astreoides). Recruitment rates were not significantly different relative to oil exposure, but number of recruits showed strong temporal variation both at the oiled and control sites. While short-term effects (1~year post-spill) could be unequivocally linked to the spill, assessment of mid-term impacts was complicated by cumulative, albeit different stressors (diseases, bleaching, warming, additional accidental oil discharges) that have been driving changes at oiled and control sites respectively and thus ultimately concealing any effects of the spill. Our data did not provide evidence of a long-term ({$>$} 10~years) chronic impact of the oil spill, but instead showed that a variety of factors have contributed to reef degradation both at oiled and control sites over the survey period.},

  abstract = {[The fecundity of clonal animals and plants is determined by the number of gravid modules (polyps, zooids, shoots, ramets) and their reproductive output. We examined the fecundity of modules (polyps) and colonies of six reef-building corals (Acropora hyacinthus, A. nana, A. gemmifera, A. millepora, Goniastrea retiformis, and Stylophora postillata) to explore how modularity influences reproductive strategies and the evolution of life histories in clonal animals. In unitary, aclonal organisms, fecundity often reaches a plateau or declines in old age. In contrast, we found that fecundity of colonies was indeterminate because vegetative growth can lead to an indefinite number of repeated, reproductive modules. However, colony fecundity was not a simple linear function of the number of modules. The species ranking of polyp fecundities (G. retiformis {$>$} the Acropora species {$>$} S. pistillata) was very different from the ranks of size-specific colony fecundities (A. hyacinthus, A. millepora, A. gemmifera {$>$} A. nana and G. retiformis). Colony fecundity for small S. pistillata was the lowest of all, but large colonies were more fecund than any of the other species at a comparable colony size (despite Stylophora having the lowest polyp fecundity). This contrast highlights clearly the effects of modularity on the reproductive biology and life histories of clonal organisms. The volume of eggs and testes, and the number of eggs and testes per polyp varied greatly among species (20-, 13-, 17-, and 3-fold, respectively). Egg volume was smallest for S. pistillata (the only brooder in the study) and for G. retiformis (which also had the most eggs per polyp, indicating a trade-off between egg size and number). The total reproductive volume per polyp (egg and testes combined) varied three-fold among the six species, and was correlated with a similar range of polyp diameters. In some cases, components of polyp fecundity depended on colony size; egg size in A. hyacinthus and A. nana and the number of planulae per polyp in S. pistillata increased by two- to fourfold with a one to two order of magnitude change in colony size. However, egg size was constant for the other species. Similarly, colony size had no effect on egg or testes number per polyp or testes volume per polyp for any species. We also found striking differences in sex allocation, which may relate to the fertilization biology of these hermaphroditic species. The ratio of total egg volume to testes volume per polyp varied fivefold, and was lowest for S. pistillata (a brooder) and G. retiformis (which produced the most and smallest eggs). The ratio increased with colony size for all species, especially A. hyacinthus. An early investment predominantly in testes allows sex to commence without the initial expense of egg production, perhaps so that colony growth can continue to a larger, safer size. All species had a characteristic colony size at maturation, which varied ninefold among taxa, corresponding to a minimum puberty age of 1-3 yr. This is the first comparative study to simultaneously measure male and female function in a range of clonal animals.]},

The availability of habitats maps improves management by guiding sampling strategies, mapping resources, involving local communities, identifying conservation areas, and facilitating Ecosystem Based Fishery Management (EBFM) approaches. However, despite their potential, very little use of products designed specifically for fishery management can be reported, likely due to high costs, inherent technology limitations and lack of awareness on the possibilities. Given the theoretical benefits brought by relevant habitat maps in EBFM frameworks, we advocate the use of adequate remote sensing products that integrate fishery technical services demands and local requirements. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The ecosystem concept has been applied to coral reefs since the time of Charles Darwin, perhaps because of the apparent integrity of the biotic-abiotic nexus. The modern model of the ecosystem as a hierarchy with emergent properties is exemplified in reefs as massive structures formed by small colonial organisms, the self-similarity of these structures across large spatial scales, and the uniformity of function by diverse biological communities. Emergent properties arise through the integration of processes up the levels of organization and larger spatial and temporal scales encompassed by a whole reef. The organic response of reef morphology to hydrodynamic forcing, the constancy and conservatism of organic production across a broad range of environments, and the global persistence of reefs in the face of massive evolutionary change in species diversity are interpreted as emergent properties. Coral reefs, of course, function by the same basic laws as other ecosystems, but there is cause to view them as an end member of a continuum because of their structural complexity and high internal cycling. Well-defined boundary conditions mean that highly integrative measures of ecosystem process based on physical and biogeochemical models (e.g. community metabolism) have provided the main applications of systems ecology to questions of coral reef function. Organism-population approaches are being reconciled with form-functional models to yield new insights to ecosystem processes and interactions among reefs and adjacent systems. The form and metabolism of reef production are strongly affected by phase shifts in benthic community structure, and most reef systems are more open to trans-boundary fluxes and external forcing than the early models suggest. The attractive paradigm of the reef as a self-sufficient ecosystem is dying slowly as research focus shifts from atolls to more open fringing and bank barrier reefs, and organic inputs to system production are measured. Coral reefs contribute little in a net sense to global ecosystem processes, but on an areal basis their exports of organic products are significant Holistic models and measures of ecosystem processes incorporate the unusual whole-part relationship of reefs and are practically essential to answering the key questions facing coral reef science in the next millennium. © Springer-Verlag 1997.},

  abstract = {The Sentinel-2A and 2B Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) offers a specification of potential value toward a number of objectives in remote sensing of coral reefs. Coral reefs represent a unique challenge for remote sensing, being highly heterogeneous at metre scales and occurring at variable depths and water clarity regimes. However, conservation initiatives, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, add urgency to the need for the large scale environmental monitoring information that remote sensing can provide. In the quest to meet this challenge a range of satellite instruments have been leveraged, from Landsat to high spatial resolution sensors such as WorldView-2, toward objectives such as: mapping of bottom types, bathymetry, change detection, and detection of coral bleaching events. Sentinel-2A and 2B offer a new paradigm of available instruments, with a 5-day revisit, 10 m multispectral spatial resolution and freely available data. Pre-launch simulation analyses by several of the authors suggested Sentinel-2 would have good performance for reef applications, in this paper we follow up on this study by reviewing the potential based on the substantial archive of actual data now available. First we determine to what extent the World's reefs are covered by Sentinel-2, since the mission requirements do not by default include all reefs. Secondly we review how a 5-day revisit translates to a usable acquisition rate of clear images, given that cloud and surface glint are common confounding factors. The usable acquisition rate is the real determinant of the objectives to which the data can be applied. Finally we apply current processing algorithms to Sentinel-2 data of several sites over the Great Barrier Reef, including physics-based bathymetry inversion and object-orientated benthic mapping. Landsat 8 OLI is most comparable current sensor to Sentinel-2 MSI, so direct comparisons and the possibilities for data synthesis are explored. Our findings confirm that Sentinel-2 has excellent performance for meeting several essential coral reef scientific and monitoring objectives. Taking into account cloud and sun glint, the usable acquisition rate for a large proportion of reefs is likely to be around 20 clear images a year on average, giving a new potential for evaluation of short time-scale disturbances and impacts. The spatial resolution of 10 m is a key threshold for delineating benthic features of interest such as coral structures, and there is evidence from image and field data that bleaching is detectable. Radiometrically Sentinel-2 data can support good results in physics-based methods, such as bathymetric mapping, comparable to Landsat 8 and WorldView-2. In addition the large scale acquisition area, provided by the 290 km wide swath, offers advantages over high spatial resolution imagery for mapping at multi-reef scales. Sentinel-2 data can be immediately leveraged with existing methods, to provide a new level of reef monitoring information compared to that previously available by remote sensing. Combined with Landsat 8 and the historical Landsat archive, the data collected today will be invaluable for decades or even centuries to come. In this context, the main downside of the Sentinel-2 mission is that approximately 12\% of the World's reefs currently lie outside the acquisition plan and are not imaged. Surprisingly, for a European initiative, coral reefs in European governed territories are among the worst served globally. These omissions, approximately only 1/200th of the currently imaged area, limit the global scope which otherwise would be one of Sentinel-2's greatest strengths.},

The model was applied to data from Pacific Ocean reefs in an airborne sensor context to estimate the primary environmental or sensor factors confounding discrimination of benthic mixtures of key reef types: live coral, bleached coral, dead coral and macroalgae. Results indicate that spectral variation of benthic types and sub-pixel mixing is the primary limiting factor for benthic mapping objectives, whereas instrument noise levels are a minor factor. © 2012 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Coral reefs are in decline worldwide and monitoring activities are important for assessing the impact of disturbance on reefs and tracking subsequent recovery or decline. Monitoring by field surveys provides accurate data but at highly localised scales and so is not cost-effective for reef scale monitoring at frequent time points. Remote sensing from satellites is an alternative and complementary approach. While remote sensing cannot provide the level of detail and accuracy at a single point than a field survey, the statistical power for inferring large scale patterns benefits in having complete areal coverage. This review considers the state of the art of coral reef remote sensing for the diverse range of objectives relevant for management, ranging from the composition of the reef: physical extent, benthic cover, bathymetry, rugosity; to environmental parameters: sea surface temperature, exposure, light, carbonate chemistry. In addition to updating previous reviews, here we also consider the capability to go beyond basic maps of habitats or environmental variables, to discuss concepts highly relevant to stakeholders, policy makers and public communication: such as biodiversity, environmental threat and ecosystem services. A clear conclusion of the review is that advances in both sensor technology and processing algorithms continue to drive forward remote sensing capability for coral reef mapping, particularly with respect to spatial resolution of maps, and synthesis across multiple data products. Both trends can be expected to continue.},

  abstract = {With uninterrupted space-based data collection since 1972, Landsat plays a key role in systematic monitoring of the Earth’s surface, enabled by an extensive and free, radiometrically consistent, global archive of imagery. Governments and international organizations rely on Landsat time series for monitoring and deriving a systematic understanding of the dynamics of the Earth’s surface at a spatial scale relevant to management, scientific inquiry, and policy development. In this study, we identify trends in Landsat-informed change detection studies by surveying 50 years of published applications, processing, and change detection methods. Specifically, a representative database was created resulting in 490 relevant journal articles derived from the Web of Science and Scopus. From these articles, we provide a review of recent developments, opportunities, and trends in Landsat change detection studies. The impact of the Landsat free and open data policy in 2008 is evident in the literature as a turning point in the number and nature of change detection studies. Based upon the search terms used and articles included, average number of Landsat images used in studies increased from 10 images before 2008 to 100,000 images in 2020. The 2008 opening of the Landsat archive resulted in a marked increase in the number of images used per study, typically providing the basis for the other trends in evidence. These key trends include an increase in automated processing, use of analysis-ready data (especially those with atmospheric correction), and use of cloud computing platforms, all over increasing large areas. The nature of change methods has evolved from representative bi-temporal pairs to time series of images capturing dynamics and trends, capable of revealing both gradual and abrupt changes. The result also revealed a greater use of nonparametric classifiers for Landsat change detection analysis. Landsat-9, to be launched in September 2021, in combination with the continued operation of Landsat-8 and integration with Sentinel-2, enhances opportunities for improved monitoring of change over increasingly larger areas with greater intra-and interannual frequency.},

  abstract = {Sea temperatures in many tropical regions have increased by almost 1°C over the past 100 years, and are currently increasing at \textasciitilde 1-2°C per century. Coral bleaching occurs when the thermal tolerance of corals and their photosynthetic symbionts (zooxanthellae) is exceeded. Mass coral bleaching has occurred in association with episodes of elevated sea temperatures over the past 20 years and involves the loss of the zooxanthellae following chronic photoinhibition. Mass bleaching has resulted in significant losses of live coral in many parts of the world. This paper considers the biochemical, physiological and ecological perspectives of coral bleaching. It also uses the outputs of four runs from three models of global climate change which simulate changes in sea temperature and hence how the frequency and intensity of bleaching events will change over the next 100 years. The results suggest that the thermal tolerances of reef-building corals are likely to be exceeded every year within the next few decades. Events as severe as the 1998 event, the worst on record, are likely to become commonplace within 20 years. Most information suggests that the capacity for acclimation by corals has already been exceeded, and that adaptation will be too slow to avert a decline in the quality of the world's reefs. The rapidity of the changes that are predicted indicates a major problem for tropical marine ecosystems and suggests that unrestrained warming cannot occur without the loss and degradation of coral reefs on a global scale.},

Dark-adapted quantum yields did not differ between symbionts in bleached and nonbleached areas. Exposing symbionts to light, however, led to greater quenching of Photosystem II in symbionts in the bleached coral. Bleached areas of the affected colonies had died by September 2003, with areas that were essentially covered by more than 80\% living coral decreasing to less than 10\% visible living coral cover. By January 2004, coral began to recover, principally from areas of colonies that were not exposed during low tide (i.e., from below dead, upper regions).

  abstract = {Bleaching (loss of pigmentation by corals) is a widespread phenomenon in coral-reef ecosystems. Despite this, the underlying causes of some forms of bleaching are poorly understood. This study explores the conditions that induce bleaching in two species of reef coral-zooxanthellae associations from Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Naturally bleached Stylophora pistillata Esper and Seriatopora hystrix Dana, collected from the edge of Lizard Island lagoon, had the same amount of Chl a · zooxanthellae−1, yet had reduced population densities of zooxanthellae when compared to normal-looking colonies. In this case, the lack of pigment in the bleached corals was explained by low numbers of zooxanthellae and not by pale zooxanthellae. This is contrary to results obtained by some other workers and suggests that closer inspection of the underlying reasons for the pale color of bleached corals is warranted. In laboratory experiments, sudden exposures to full sunlight induced the bleaching of S. pistillata previously grown at 25\% sunlight. The pale color of colonies exposed to full sunlight was explained by the low pigment content of the zooxanthellae rather than by low population densities of zooxanthellae. In addition, the specific expulsion rate of zooxanthellae from S. Pistillata and S. hystrix was not influenced by sudden increases in solar irradiance. Sudden exposures to reduced salinities (30\%.) did not affect S. Pistillata or S. hystrix in this study. Both species bleached rapidly, however, when exposed to water temperatures of {$>$} 30 °C. Bleached corals in this case had reduced population densities of zooxanthellae despite normal zooxanthella pigment contents. The specific expulsion rate of zooxanthellae from both species of coral was very sensitive to temperature. 7-h exposures to 30 and 32 °C resulted in specific expulsion rates of {$>$} 1000 times that of controls. Specific expulsion rates remained high, even when corals were returned to control temperatures (27 °C). After high temperature stress, S. Pistillata and S. hystrix had high and sustained colony respiratory rates (rc), reduced colony photosynthetic rates (pcnetmax) and reduced Pcgmax: rc ratios. The O2 metabolism of the S. pistillata and S. hystrix symbioses remained abnormal for up to 4 days after a 7-h exposure to 32 °C. Evidence suggestive of recovery was apparent 19 days later. By this time, the mean population density of zooxanthellae and pcgmax:rc ratios of exposed fragments had returned to normal.},

Recent advances in microelectronics and battery technology have resulted in the rapid development of low-cost UASs that are transforming many industries. Drones are poised to revolutionize marine science and conservation, as they provide essentially on-demand remote sensing capabilities at low cost and with reduced human risk. A variety of multirotor, fixed-wing, and transitional UAS platforms are capable of carrying various optical and physical sampling payloads and are being employed in almost every subdiscipline of marine science and conservation. This article provides an overview of the UAS platforms and sensors used in marine science and conservation missions along with example physical, biological, and natural resource management applications and typical analytical workflows. It concludes with details on potential effects of UASs on marine wildlife and a look to the future of UASs in marine science and conservation.},

Yet classifications underpinning large-scale reef mapping to date are typically poorly defined, not shared or region-specific, limiting end-users’ ability to interpret outputs. Here we present Reef Cover, a coral reef geomorphic zone classification, developed to support both producers and end-users of global-scale coral reef habitat maps, in a transparent and version-based framework. Scalable classes were created by focusing on attributes that can be observed remotely, but whose membership rules also reflect deep knowledge of reef form and functioning. Bridging the divide between earth observation data and geo-ecological knowledge of reefs, Reef Cover maximises the trade-off between applicability at global scales, and relevance and accuracy at local scales. Two case studies demonstrate application of the Reef Cover classification scheme and its scientific and conservation benefits: 1) detailed mapping of the Cairns Management Region of the Great Barrier Reef to support management and 2) mapping of the Caroline and Mariana Island chains in the Pacific for conservation purposes.},

  abstract = {Coral reefs are net sinks for C, principally as CaCO3 accretion. It is possible to predict quite accurately the rate of production, given adequate information about any particular reef environment. The best data set for an extensive region is that for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Careful analysis of this region and the incorporation of previously documented present day system calcification rates suggest net production (G) from G = 1 (kg CaCO3 m-2 yr-1) for fringing reefs, to G = 1.9 for planar (infiled platform) reefs, G = 3 for ribbon reefs and lagoonal reefs. The 20,055 km2 of reefs in the GBR are thus estimated to average G = 2.4, resulting in a total production of ∼ 50 million tonnes yr-1. In a 50-100 year Greenhouse scenario of rising sealevel, we predict that recolonisation of present day reef flats will be extensive and prolific. Production will increase substantially, and this could be by as much as ∼ 40\% (ranging from 0\% for deep shoals to 180\% for fringing reefs) to give ∼ 70 million tonnes yr-1 if the rate of sealevel rise reaches or exceeds 6-8 mm yr-1. We estimate 115,000 km2 of oceanic atolls worldwide. Drawing on points equivalence from the detailed analysis of the GBR, we estimate the atolls presently produce 160 million tonnes yr-1. We predict that a similar ∼ 40\% increase could be possible in the next 100 years or so resulting in a production of 220 million tonnes. Accepting an existing estimate of 617,000 km2 for reefs worldwide, drawing from our projections from the GBR and the atolls, and making some assumptions about the remaining reef types (we suggest fringing reefs to dominate) we estimate global reef production at the present time to be ∼ 900 million tonnes yr-1. Within the next 100 years or so, we suggest this rate could almost double to ∼ 1800 million tonnes. In the long term (several centuries) we predict that the continuing trend of recolonisation, particularly of fringing and planar reefs could result in the production of {$>$} 3000 million tonnes yr-1 if rates of sealevel rise approaching or exceeding 6-8 mm yr-1 are achieved. Eventually ({$>$} 500 yr), reefs could actually "drown" due to inability to match the rate of sealevel increase if that rate significantly exceeds 6-8 mm yr-1. Thus, coral reefs at present act as a sink for 111 million tonnes C yr-1, the equivalent of 2\% of present output of anthropogenic CO2. In the short term Greenhouse scenario (100 yr) we predict this could increase to the equivalent of ∼ 4\% of the present CO2 output. In the much longer term (several centuries), if all trends continue, this could increase to the equivalent of as much as ∼ 9\% of the present CO2 output. Unfortunately, we also predict that this considerable sink for C will be most likely of negative value in alleviating Greenhouse because of the immediate effect of CaCO3 precipitation is to raise the PCO2 of the surface oceans - ie, ot encourage CO2 efflux to the atmosphere. We do not attempt to quantify this effect. Other Greenhouse changes such as seawater temperature increase, changes in cloud cover, increased rainfall and runoff, increased storm activity, and changes in dissolved CO2 concentration and surface ocean circulation may complicate the reef response. However, we suggest that sealevel rise will be the dominant influence, at least during the next 100 years or so. © 1991.}

  abstract = {The use of marine spatial planning for zoning multi-use areas is growing in both developed and developing countries. Comprehensive maps of marine resources, including those important for local fisheries management and biodiversity conservation, provide a crucial foundation of information for the planning process. Using a combination of field and high spatial resolution satellite data, we use an empirical procedure to create a bathymetric map (RMSE 1.76 m) and object-based image analysis to produce accurate maps of geomorphic and benthic coral reef classes (Kappa values of 0.80 and 0.63; 9 and 33 classes, respectively) covering a large ({$>$}260 km2) traditional fisheries management area in Fiji. From these maps, we derive per-pixel information on habitat richness, structural complexity, coral cover and the distance from land, and use these variables as input in models to predict fish species richness, diversity and biomass. We show that random forest models outperform five other model types, and that all three fish community variables can be satisfactorily predicted from the high spatial resolution satellite data. We also show geomorphic zone to be the most important predictor on average, with secondary contributions from a range of other variables including benthic class, depth, distance from land, and live coral cover mapped at coarse spatial scales, suggesting that data with lower spatial resolution and lower cost may be sufficient for spatial predictions of the three fish community variables.},

  abstract = {Increasingly intense marine heatwaves threaten the persistence of many marine ecosys-tems. Heat stress-mediated episodes of mass coral bleaching have led to catastrophic coral mortality globally. Remotely monitoring and forecasting such biotic responses to heat stress is key for effective marine ecosystem management. The Degree Heating Week (DHW) metric, designed to monitor coral bleaching risk, reflects the duration and intensity of heat stress events and is computed by accumulat-ing SST anomalies (HotSpot) relative to a stress threshold over a 12-week moving window. Despite significant improvements in the underlying SST datasets, corresponding revisions of the HotSpot threshold and accumulation window are still lacking. Here, we fine-tune the operational DHW algorithm to optimise coral bleaching predictions using the 5 km satellite-based SSTs (CoralTemp v3.1) and a global coral bleaching dataset (37,871 observations, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). After developing 234 test DHW algorithms with different combinations of the HotSpot threshold and accumulation window, we compared their bleaching prediction ability using spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical models and sensitivity–specificity analyses. Peak DHW performance was reached using HotSpot thresholds less than or equal to the maximum of monthly means SST climatology (MMM) and accumulation windows of 4–8 weeks. This new configuration correctly predicted up to an additional 310 bleaching observations globally compared to the operational DHW algorithm, an improved hit rate of 7.9\%. Given the detrimental impacts of marine heatwaves across ecosystems, heat stress algorithms could also be fine-tuned for other biological systems, improving scientific accuracy, and enabling ecosystem governance.},

The likelihood of disease increases from 4\% to 89\% when corals are in contact with plastic. Structurally complex corals are eight times more likely to be affected by plastic, suggesting that microhabitats for reef-associated organisms and valuable fisheries will be disproportionately affected. Plastic levels on coral reefs correspond to estimates of terrestrial mismanaged plastic waste entering the ocean.We estimate that 11.1 billion plastic items are entangled on coral reefs across the Asia-Pacific and project this number to increase 40\% by 2025. Plastic waste management is critical for reducing diseases that threaten ecosystem health and human livelihoods.}

The modeling capabilities of the ML-based methods have resulted in their extensive applications in science and engineering.

The unique features of some of the ML techniques will be outlined with a specific attention to genetic programming paradigm.

Its spectral resolution and quality are high but its spatial resolutions, of at most 10 m, is not sufficient for fine scale analysis. A novel method was thus proposed to super-resolve S2 imagery to 2.5 m. For a given S2 tile, the 10 S2 bands (four at 10mand six at 20 m) were fused with additional images acquired at higher spatial resolution by the PlanetScope (PS) constellation. The radiometric inconsistencies between PS microsatellites were normalized. Radiometric normalization and super-resolution were achieved simultaneously using state-of-the-art super-resolution residual convolutional neural networks adapted to the particularities of S2 and PS imageries (including masks of clouds and shadows). The method is described in detail, from image selection and downloading to neural network architecture, training, and prediction. The quality was thoroughly assessed visually (photointerpretation) and quantitatively, confirming that the proposed method is highly spatially and spectrally accurate. The method is also robust and can be applied to S2 images acquired worldwide at any date.},

However, such maps are difficult to generate due to the broad geographic range of coral reefs, the complexities of relating satellite imagery to geomorphic or ecological realities, and other challenges. However, reef extent maps are one of the most commonly used and most valuable data products from the perspective of reef scientists and managers. Here, we used convolutional neural networks to generate a globally consistent coral reef probability map—a probabilistic estimate of the geospatial extent of reef ecosystems—to facilitate scientific, conservation, and management efforts. We combined a global mosaic of high spatial resolution Planet Dove satellite imagery with regional Millennium Coral Reef Mapping Project reef extents to build training, validation, and application datasets. These datasets trained our reef extent prediction model, a neural network with a dense-unet architecture followed by a random forest classifier, which was used to produce a global coral reef probability map. Based on this probability map, we generated a global coral reef extent map from a 60\% threshold of reef probability (reef: probability ≥ 60\%, non-reef: probability {$<$} 60\%). Our findings provide a proof-of-concept method for global reef extent estimates using a consistent and readily updateable methodology that leverages modern deep learning approaches to support downstream users. These maps are openly-available through the Allen Coral Atlas.},

  abstract = {To forecast the terrestrial carbon cycle and monitor food security, vegetation growth must be accurately predicted; however, current process-based ecosystem and crop-growth models are limited in their effectiveness. This study developed a machine learning model using the extreme gradient boosting method to predict vegetation growth throughout the growing season in China from 2001 to 2018. The model used satellite-derived vegetation data for the first month of each growing season, CO2 concentration, and several meteorological factors as data sources for the explanatory variables. Results showed that the model could reproduce the spatiotemporal distribution of vegetation growth as represented by the satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The predictive error for the growing season NDVI was less than 5\% for more than 98\% of vegetated areas in China; the model represented seasonal variations in NDVI well. The coefficient of determination (R2) between the monthly observed and predicted NDVI was 0.83, and more than 69\% of vegetated areas had an R2 \&gt; 0.8. The effectiveness of the model was examined for a severe drought year (2009), and results showed that the model could reproduce the spatiotemporal distribution of NDVI even under extreme conditions. This model provides an alternative method for predicting vegetation growth and has great potential for monitoring vegetation dynamics and crop growth.}

  abstract = {Understanding the effects of elevated seawater temperatures on each member of the coral holobiont (the complex comprised of coral polyps and associated symbiotic microorganisms, including Bacteria, viruses, Fungi, Archaea and endolithic algae) is becoming increasingly important as evidence accumulates that microbial members contribute to overall coral health, particularly during thermal stress. Here we use a metagenomic approach to identify metabolic and taxonomic shifts in microbial communities associated with the hard coral Acropora millepora throughout a natural thermal bleaching event at Magnetic Island (Great Barrier Reef). A direct comparison of metagenomic data sets from healthy versus bleached corals indicated major shifts in microbial associates during heat stress, including Bacteria, Archaea, viruses, Fungi and micro-algae. Overall, metabolism of the microbial community shifted from autotrophy to heterotrophy, including increases in genes associated with the metabolism of fatty acids, proteins, simple carbohydrates, phosphorus and sulfur. In addition, the proportion of virulence genes was higher in the bleached library, indicating an increase in microorganisms capable of pathogenesis following bleaching. These results demonstrate that thermal stress results in shifts in coral-associated microbial communities that may lead to deteriorating coral health. © 2011 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Image fusion techniques are widely used to integrate a lower spatial resolution multispectral image with a higher spatial resolution panchromatic image, such as Thematic Mapper (TM) multispectral band and SPOT Panchromatic images. However, the existing techniques either cannot avoid distorting the image spectral properties or involve complicated and time-consuming frequency decomposition and re-construction processing. A simple spectral preserve fusion technique: The Smoothing Filter-based Intensity Modulation (SFIM) has thus been developed based on a simplified solar radiation and land surface reflection model. By using a ratio between a higher resolution image and its low pass filtered (with a smoothing filter) image, spatial details can be modulated to a co-registered lower resolution multispectral image without altering its spectral properties and contrast. The technique can be applied to improve spatial resolution for either colour composites or individual bands. The fidelity to spectral property and the spatial textural quality of SFIM are convincingly demonstrated by an image fusion experiment using TM and SPOT Panchromatic images of south-east Spain. The visual evaluation and statistical analysis compared with HSI and Brovey transform techniques confirmed that SFIM is a superior fusion technique for improving spatial detail of multispectral images with their spectral properties reliably preserved.},

In this sense, WorldView-2 is a very high resolution satellite, which provides an advanced multispectral sensor with eight narrow bands, allowing the proliferation of new environmental monitoring and mapping applications in shallow coastal ecosystems. These challenges need the accurate determination of the water radiance, which is not often valued compared to other sources such as atmosphere and specular water reflection (sun glint). In this context, the atmospheric correction and the glinting removal have demonstrated to be critical steps in the preprocessing chain of high resolution images. In this work, the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) is used to compensate the atmospheric effects and to compute part of the deglinting algorithm using the modeled direct normalized irradiance. This paper describes a novel automatic deglinting procedure, integrated in the Radiative Transfer Modeling (RTM) inversion of the shallow water environments, which allows computing the water Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs), bathymetry and seafloor albedo contributions. The proposed methodology has demonstrated a proper performance for environmental monitoring in shallow water areas.},

Extensive loss of reef corals following recent mass bleaching events have challenged the notion that support of system resilience is a viable reef management strategy. While resilience-based management (RBM) cannot prevent the damaging effects of major disturbances, such as mass bleaching events, it can support natural processes that promote resistance and recovery. Here, we review the potential of RBM to help sustain coral reefs in the 21st century. We explore the scope for supporting resilience through existing management approaches and emerging technologies and discuss their opportunities and limitations in a changing climate. We argue that for RBM to be effective in a changing world, reef management strategies need to involve both existing and new interventions that together reduce stress, support the fitness of populations and species, and help people and economies to adapt to a highly altered ecosystem.},

Today, demand for travel exhibits greater variation and magnitude than ever in history. In response, the tourism industry has become the largest business on earth. This, coupled with the respect people profess for marine environments and local peoples, creates feelings of ambivalence for the tourist. Sociologically, the activity of tourism may be studied as a symbolic interaction fostering social solidarity. Ecotourism, a recent phenomenon attuned to the ideal of sustainable development, is suggested to emerge through the social construction processes of restoration and enhancement. The papers in this theme volume add fuel to the proposition that the resolution of tourism problems in the coastal zone will require the scientific study of environmental and social conditions, policy analyses, planning, and public education. © 1993.}

Goods are divided into renewable resources and reef mining. Ecological services are classified into physical structure services, biotic services, biogeochemical services, information services, and social/cultural services. A review of economic valuation studies reveals that only a few of the goods and services of reefs have been captured. We synthesize current understanding of the relationships between ecological services and functional groups of species and biological communities of coral reefs in different regions of the world. The consequences of human impacts on coral reefs are also discussed, including loss of resilience, or buffer capacity. Such loss may impair the capacity for recovery of coral reefs and as a consequence the quality and quantity of their delivery of ecological goods and services. Conserving the capacity of reefs to generate essential services requires that they are managed as components of a larger seascape-landscape of which human activities are seen as integrated parts.},

A precise mapping of coral reef habitat with high spatial and time resolutions has become a necessary step for monitoring their health and evolution. This mapping can be achieved remotely thanks to satellite imagery coupled with machine-learning algorithms. In this paper, we review the different satellites used in recent literature, as well as the most common and efficient machine-learning methods. To account for the recent explosion of published research on coral reel mapping, we especially focus on the papers published between 2018 and 2020. Our review study indicates that object-based methods provide more accurate results than pixel-based ones, and that the most accurate methods are Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. We emphasize that the satellites with the highest spatial resolution provide the best images for benthic habitat mapping. We also highlight that preprocessing steps (water column correction, sunglint removal, etc.) and additional inputs (bathymetry data, aerial photographs, etc.) can significantly improve the mapping accuracy.},

Despite recent advances in the field of earth observation, many of these have remained undetected as RTS are highly dynamic, small, and scattered across the remote permafrost region. Here, we assessed the potential strengths and limitations of using deep learning for the automatic segmentation of RTS using PlanetScope satellite imagery, ArcticDEM and auxiliary datasets. We analyzed the transferability and potential for pan- Arctic upscaling and regional cross-validation, with independent training and validation regions, in six different thaw slump-affected regions in Canada and Russia. We further tested state-ofthe- art model architectures (UNet, UNet++, DeepLabv3) and encoder networks to find optimal model configurations for potential upscaling to continental scales. The best deep learning models achieved mixed results from good to very good agreement in four of the six regions (maxIoU: 0.39 to 0.58, Lena River, Horton Delta, Herschel Island, Kolguev Island), while they failed in two regions (Banks Island, Tuktoyaktuk). Of the tested architectures, UNet++ performed the best. The large variance in regional performance highlights the requirement for a sufficient quantity, quality and spatial variability in the training data used for segmenting RTS across diverse permafrost landscapes, in varying environmental conditions. With our highly automated and configurable workflow, we see great potential for the transfer to active RTS clusters (e.g., Peel Plateau) and upscaling to much larger regions.},

Metabolic activity and nutrient concentrations were routinely measured at three study sites: (1) on the reef flat, (2) in the lagoon, and (3) 10-50 m off the reef. Sampling was undertaken during low spring tide events, when the atoll was temporarily emerged, over five periods in 1993-95. Two of the five sampling periods included both day and night sampling. Alkalinity, Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and pH varied slightly among sampling periods, however there were no differences in the range of variation. Compared to the lagoon and open waters, the reef flat had significantly lower alkalinity and DIC, and significantly higher DO and pH during the day. ΔDIC reached a maximum shortly before sunrise and was closely coupled with total alkalinity over the diel cycle. Rates of net organic carbon production and calcification for the reef flat were estimated at 12 mmol m-2 h-1 and 9 mmol m-2 h-1, respectively, although calcification was low (i.e., under the detection limit) at night. The respiration rate of the reef flat was approximately 6 mmol m-2 h-1. A comparison of CO2 released by calcification and net organic production indicates that this reef flat acted as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide in the daytime, but acted as a source at night, and that the net CO2 diel budget was almost equally balanced.}

  abstract = {Tropical reefs have been impacted by thermal anomalies caused by global warming that induced coral bleaching and mortality events globally. However, there have only been very few recordings of bleaching within the Red Sea despite covering a latitudinal range of 15° and consequently it has been considered a region that is less sensitive to thermal anomalies. We therefore examined historical patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) and associated anomalies (1982–2012) and compared warming trends with a unique compilation of corresponding coral bleaching records from throughout the region. These data indicated that the northern Red Sea has not experienced mass bleaching despite intensive Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) of {$>$}15°C-weeks. Severe bleaching was restricted to the central and southern Red Sea where DHWs have been more frequent, but far less intense (DHWs {$<$}4°C-weeks). A similar pattern was observed during the 2015–2016 El Niño event during which time corals in the northern Red Sea did not bleach despite high thermal stress (i.e. DHWs {$>$}8°C-weeks), and bleaching was restricted to the central and southern Red Sea despite the lower thermal stress (DHWs~{$<~$}8°C-weeks). Heat stress assays carried out in the northern (Hurghada) and central (Thuwal) Red Sea on four key reef-building species confirmed different regional thermal susceptibility, and that central Red Sea corals are more sensitive to thermal anomalies as compared to those from the north. Together, our data demonstrate that corals in the northern Red Sea have a much higher heat tolerance than their prevailing temperature regime would suggest. In contrast, corals from the central Red Sea are close to their thermal limits, which closely match the maximum annual water temperatures. The northern Red Sea harbours reef-building corals that live well below their bleaching thresholds and thus we propose that the region represents a thermal refuge of global importance.},

In this research we test shallow and deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) for Landsat image super-resolution enhancement, trained using Sentinel-2, in three study sites representing boreal forest, tundra, and cropland/woodland environments. The analysis sought to assess baseline performance and determine the capacity for spatial and temporal extension of the trained CNNs. This is not a data fusion approach and a high-resolution image is only needed to train the CNN. Results show improvement with the deeper network generally achieving better results. For spatial and temporal extension, the deep CNN performed the same or better than the shallow CNN, but at greater computational cost. Results for temporal extension were influenced by change potentiality reducing the performance difference between the shallow and deep CNN. Visual examination revealed sharper images regarding land cover boundaries, linear features, and within-cover textures. The results suggest that spatial enhancement of the Landsat archive is feasible, with optimal performance where CNNs can be trained and applied within the same spatial domain. Future research will assess the enhancement on time series and associated land cover applications.},

Conservation and management imply continuous monitoring and mapping of their spatial distribution at first. The present study explores the capabilities of the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission and the contribution of its coastal aerosol band 1 (443 nm) for the mapping of the dominant Mediterranean coastal marine habitats and the bathymetry in three survey sites in the East Mediterranean. The selected sites have shallow to deep habitats and a high variability of oceanographic and seabed morphological conditions. The major findings of our study demonstrate the advantages of the downscaled Sentinel-2 coastal aerosol band 1 for both optically shallow habitat and satellite-derived bathymetry mapping due to its great water penetration. The use of Sentinel-2 band 1 allows detection of Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds down to 32.2 m of depth. Sentinel-2 constellation with its 10-m spatial resolution at most of the spectral bands, 5-day revisit frequency and open data policy can be an important tool to provide crucial missing information on the spatial distribution of coastal habitats and on their bathymetry distribution, especially in data-poor and/or remote areas with large gaps in a retrospective, rapid and non-intrusive manner. As such, it becomes a crucial ally for the conservation and management of coastal habitats globally.},

  abstract = {Carbonate sequence stratigraphy is founded on the principle that changes in relative sea-level are recorded in the rock record by the accumulation of sediment with relative water depth-dependent attributes. While at the scale of a shelf to basin transect, facies clearly arrange by water depth, the relation blurs for depths {$<$}40 m, the most vigorous zone of carbonate production. The reason for this change in behaviour is two-fold. Firstly, in shallow water, the intrinsic processes of storm and wave reworking influence the seabed through submarine erosion and sediment redistribution. Secondly, facies diversity tends to be greater in shallow water than deep water because of a greater diversity in grain producers. Remote sensing imagery, field observations and hydrodynamic models for two reef-rimmed shore-attached carbonate platforms in the Red Sea show neither water depth nor energy regime to be reliable indicators of facies type when considered in isolation. Considered together, however, the predictive power of the two variables rises significantly. The results demonstrate it to be an oversimplification to assume a direct link between palaeo-water depth and depositional diversity of subtidal lithofacies, while highlighting the importance of hydrodynamics in directing the accumulation of carbonate sediments in the shallow photic zone. While the size distributions of facies extents in the two focus areas follow power laws, no direct relation between the lateral continuity of the facies belts and water depth or wave height is reported. The work is relevant for the interpretation of metre-scale subtidal carbonate cycles throughout the geological record by demonstrating how caution must be applied when inferring palaeo-water depths from depositional facies.},

Recent studies implicate high salinity as a contributing factor in cnidarians, potentially explaining the high thermotolerance of corals from the Arabian Seas. Here we characterized bacterial community composition under heat stress at different salinities using the coral model Aiptasia. Exposure of two Aiptasia host-algal symbiont pairings (H2-SSB01 and CC7-SSA01) to ambient (25°C) and heat stress (34°C) temperatures at low (36 PSU), intermediate (39 PSU), and high (42 PSU) salinities showed that bacterial community composition at high salinity was significantly different, concomitant with reduced bleaching susceptibility in H2-SSB01, not observed in CC7-SSA01. Elucidation of bacteria that showed increased relative abundance at high salinity, irrespective of heat stress, revealed candidate taxa that could potentially contribute to the observed increased thermotolerance. We identified 4 (H2-SSB01) and 3 (CC7-SSA01) bacterial taxa belonging to the orders Alteromonadales (1 OTU), Oligoflexales (1 OTU), Rhizobiales (2 OTUs), and Rhodobacterales (2 OTUs), suggesting that only few bacterial taxa are potential contributors to an increase in thermal tolerance at high salinities. These taxa have previously been implicated in nitrogen and DMSP cycling, processes that are considered to affect thermotolerance. Our study demonstrates microbiome restructuring in symbiotic cnidarians under heat stress at different salinities. As such, it underlines how host-associated bacterial communities adapt to prevailing environmental conditions with putative consequences for the environmental stress tolerance of the emergent metaorganism.},

Analyses of the geographic ranges of 3235 species of reef fish, corals, snails, and lobsters revealed that between 7.2\% and 53.6\% of each taxon have highly restricted ranges, rendering them vulnerable to extinction. Restricted-range species are clustered into centers of endemism, like those described for terrestrial taxa. The 10 richest centers of endemism cover 15.8\% of the world's coral reefs (0.012\% of the oceans) but include between 44.8 and 54.2\% of the restricted-range species. Many occur in regions where reefs are being severely affected by people, potentially leading to numerous extinctions. Threatened centers of endemism are major biodiversity hotspots, and conservation efforts targeted toward them could help avert the loss of tropical reef biodiversity.}

Direct application to multi- and hyperspectral imagery of supervised (shallow or deep) convolutional networks is very challenging given the high input data dimensionality and the relatively small amount of available labeled data. Therefore, we propose the use of greedy layerwise unsupervised pretraining coupled with a highly efficient algorithm for unsupervised learning of sparse features. The algorithm is rooted on sparse representations and enforces both population and lifetime sparsity of the extracted features, simultaneously. We successfully illustrate the expressive power of the extracted representations in several scenarios: classification of aerial scenes, as well as land-use classification in very high resolution or land-cover classification from multi- and hyperspectral images. The proposed algorithm clearly outperforms standard principal component analysis (PCA) and its kernel counterpart (kPCA), as well as current state-of-the-art algorithms of aerial classification, while being extremely computationally efficient at learning representations of data. Results show that single-layer convolutional networks can extract powerful discriminative features only when the receptive field accounts for neighboring pixels and are preferred when the classification requires high resolution and detailed results. However, deep architectures significantly outperform single-layer variants, capturing increasing levels of abstraction and complexity throughout the feature hierarchy.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for the detection of coral bleaching using satellite time-series data. While the detection of coral bleaching from satellite imagery is difficult due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of benthic reflectance, we overcame this difficulty using three approaches: 1) specialized pre-processing developed for Planet Dove satellites, 2) a time-series approach for determining baseline reflectance statistics, and 3) a regional filter based on a preexisting map of live coral. The time-series was divided into a baseline period (April-July 2019), when no coral bleaching was known to have taken place, and a bleaching period (August 2019-present), when the bleaching was known to have occurred based on field data. The identification of the bleaching period allowed the computation of a Standardized Bottom Reflectance (SBR) for each region. SBR transforms the weekly bottom reflectance into a value relative to the baseline reflectance distribution statistics, increasing the sensitivity to bleaching detection. We tested three scales of the temporal smoothing of the SBR (weekly, cumulative average, and three-week moving average). Our field verification of coral bleaching throughout the main Hawaiian Islands showed that the cumulative average and three-week moving average smoothing detected the highest proportion of coral bleaching locations, correctly identifying 11 and 10 out of 18 locations, respectively. However, the three-week moving average provided a better sensitivity in coral bleaching detection, with a performance increase of at least one standard deviation, which helps define the confidence level of a detected bleaching event.},

Due to AMD, lakes that were formed in the post mining landscapes in the lignite mining area of Central Germany are characterized by specific limnological development changes. Remote sensing is a time and cost saving technique that enables the observation of the hydrological and limnological development of the lakes ranging from a small to a mid size scale. The current research was based on Landsat TM5/ETM+7 satellite data collected between 1999 and 2004. In combination of satellite data, surface waters of the post mining lakes in Central Germany were sampled and analyzed for their physicochemical properties. The objective of this approach was to evaluate the environmental conditions and to develop a monitoring system. On the other hand, the research was conducted to assess the potential of the use of satellite data and to calibrate its content for monitoring the geochemistry of mining lakes. Correlation of hydrochemical parameters of lake water to spectral signatures detected by satellites was performed with multivariate statistical analysis methods. The five determined clusters of spectral partitions described the actual data (ground truth data) within the visible range. The statistically identified clusters were combined with expert knowledge in limnology, geology and water chemistry of large scale lakes in open cast mining areas, in order to analyze the spectral information of the satellite images scientifically. The utilization of spectral signatures revealed an acceptable classification of hydrological and hydrochemical properties of mining lakes and established the basis for further investigation of open cast lignite mining concerning the environmental impact, particularly in areas where lignite mining lakes usually form. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The reduced G {$<$}inf{$>$}net{$<$}/inf{$>$} most likely reflects the almost threefold increase in dissolution rates, possibly resulting from increased bioerosion due to changes in the biota (e.g., sea cucumbers, boring organisms) and/or from greater chemical dissolution produced by changing abiotic conditions over the past 40 years associated with climate change, such as increased temperatures and ocean acidification. However, at this stage of research on One Tree Island the effects of these changes are not entirely understood. © 2012. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.}

  abstract = {Global coral reef related tourism is one of the most significant examples of nature-based tourism from a single ecosystem. Coral reefs attract foreign and domestic visitors and generate revenues, including foreign exchange earnings, in over 100 countries and territories. Understanding the full value of coral reefs to tourism, and the spatial distribution of these values, provides an important incentive for sustainable reef management. In the current work, global data from multiple sources, including social media and crowd-sourced datasets, were used to estimate and map two distinct components of reef value. The first component is local “reef-adjacent” value, an overarching term used to capture a range of indirect benefits from coral reefs, including provision of sandy beaches, sheltered water, food, and attractive views. The second component is “on-reef” value, directly associated with in-water activities such diving and snorkelling. Tourism values were estimated as a proportion of the total visits and spending by coastal tourists within 30~km of reefs (excluding urban areas). Reef-adjacent values were set as a fixed proportion of 10\% of this expenditure. On-reef values were based on the relative abundance of dive-shops and underwater photos in different countries and territories. Maps of value assigned to specific coral reef locations show considerable spatial variability across distances of just a few kilometres. Some 30\% of the world's reefs are of value in the tourism sector, with a total value estimated at nearly US\$36 billion, or over 9\% of all coastal tourism value in the world's coral reef countries.},

  abstract = {The coral reefs are important ecosystems to protect underwater life and coastal areas. It is also a natural attraction that attracts many tourists to eco-tourism under the sea. However, the impact of climate change has led to coral reef bleaching and elevated mortality rates. Thus, this paper modeled and predicted coral reef bleaching under climate change by using machine learning techniques to provide the data to support coral reefs protection. Supervised machine learning was used to predict the level of coral damage based on previous information, while unsupervised machine learning was applied to model the coral reef bleaching area and discovery knowledge of the relationship among bleaching factors. In supervised machine learning, three widely used algorithms were included: Na\&iuml;ve Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree. The accuracy of classifying coral reef bleaching under climate change was compared between these three models. Unsupervised machine learning based on a clustering technique was used to group similar characteristics of coral reef bleaching. Then, the correlation between bleaching conditions and characteristics was examined. We used a 5-year dataset obtained from the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, Thailand, during 2013\&ndash;2018. The results showed that SVM was the most effective classification model with 88.85\% accuracy, followed by decision tree and Na\&iuml;ve Bayes that achieved 80.25\% and 71.34\% accuracy, respectively. In unsupervised machine learning, coral reef characteristics were clustered into six groups, and we found that seawater pH and sea surface temperature correlated with coral reef bleaching.},

  abstract = {The seawater CO2 system and carbon budget were examined in coral reefs of wide variety with respect to topographic types and oceanographic settings in the Indo-Pacific oceans. A system-level net organic-to-inorganic carbon production ratio (R01) is a master parameter for controlling the carbon cycle in coral reef systems, including their sink/source behavior for atmospheric CO2. A reef system with R01 less than approximately 0.6 has a potential for releasing CO2. The production ratio, however, is not easy to estimate on a particular reef. Instead, observations planned to detect the offshore-lagoon difference in partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and a graphic approach based on a total alkalinity-dissolved inorganic carbon diagram can reveal system-level performance of the carbon cycle in coral reefs. Surface pCO2 values in the lagoons of atolls and barrier reefs were consistently higher than those in their offshore waters, showing differences between 6 and 46 μatm, together with a depletion in total alkalinity up to 100 μmo1 kg-1, indicating predominant carbonate production relative to net organic carbon production. Reef topography, especially residence time of lagoon water, has a secondary effect on the magnitude of the offshore-lagoon pCO2 difference. Terrestrial influence was recognized in costal reefs, including the GBR lagoon and a fringing reef of the Ryukyu Islands. High carbon input appears to enhance CO2 efflux to the atmosphere because of their high dissolved C:P ratios. Coral reefs, in general, act as an alkalinity sink and a potentially CO2-releasing site due to carbonate precipitation and land-derived carbon.}

  abstract = {Seawater reverse osmosis desalination concentrate may have chronic and/or acute impacts on the marine ecosystems in the near-field area of the discharge. Environmental impact of the desalination plant discharge is supposedly site- and volumetric- specific, and also depends on the salinity tolerance of the organisms inhabiting the water column in and around a discharge environment. Scientific studies that aim to understand possible impacts of elevated salinity levels are important to assess detrimental effects to organisms, especially for species with no mechanism of osmoregulation, e.g., presumably corals. Previous studies on corals indicate sensitivity toward hypo- and hyper-saline environments with small changes in salinity already affecting coral physiology. In order to evaluate sensitivity of Red Sea corals to increased salinity levels, we conducted a long-term (29 days) in situ salinity tolerance transect study at an offshore seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) discharge on the coral Fungia granulosa. While we measured a pronounced increase in salinity and temperature at the direct outlet of the discharge structure, effects were indistinguishable from the surrounding environment at a distance of 5 m. Interestingly, corals were not affected by varying salinity levels as indicated by measurements of the photosynthetic efficiency. Similarly, cultured coral symbionts of the genus Symbiodinium displayed remarkable tolerance levels in regard to hypo- and hypersaline treatments. Our data suggest that increased salinity and temperature levels from discharge outlets wear off quickly in the surrounding environment. Furthermore, F. granulosa seem to tolerate levels of salinity that are distinctively higher than reported for other corals previously. It remains to be determined whether Red Sea corals in general display increased salinity tolerance, and whether this is related to prevailing levels of high(er) salinity in the Red Sea in comparison to other oceans.},

Imagery from the operational land imager (OLI) on Landsat 8, the multispectral instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2 A and B, and the PlanetScope CubeSat constellation was processed for both sites using a fixed atmospheric path reflectance in a small region of interest around the system’s deployment location, using a number of processing settings, including a new sky reflectance correction. The mean absolute relative differences (MARD) between in situ and satellite measured reflectances reach {$<$}20\% in the Blue and 11\% in the Green bands around 490 and 560 nm for the best performing configuration for MSI and OLI. Higher relative errors are found for the shortest Blue bands around 440 nm (30–100\% MARD), and in the Red-Edge and near-infrared bands (35–100\% MARD), largely influenced by the lower absolute data range in the observations. Root mean squared differences (RMSD) increase from 0.005 in the NIR to about 0.015–0.020 in the Blue band, consistent with increasing atmospheric path reflectance. Validation of the Red-Edge and NIR bands on Sentinel-2 is presented, as well as for the first time, the Panchromatic band (17–26\% MARD) on Landsat 8, and the derived Orange contra-band (8–33\% MARD for waters in the algorithm domain, and around 40–80\% MARD overall). For Sentinel-2, excluding the SWIR bands from the DSF gave better performances, likely due to calibration issues of MSI at longer wavelengths. Excluding the SWIR on Landsat 8 gave good performance as well, indicating robustness of the DSF to the available band set. The DSF performance was found to be rather insensitive to (1) the wavelength spacing in the lookup tables used for the atmospheric correction, (2) the use of default or ancillary information on gas concentration and atmospheric pressure, and (3) the size of the ROI over which the path reflectance is estimated. The performance of the PlanetScope constellation is found to be similar to previously published results, with the standard DSF giving the best results in the visible bands in terms of MARD (24–40\% overall, and 18–29\% for the turbid site). The new sky reflectance correction gave mixed results, although it reduced the mean biases for certain configurations and improved results for the processing excluding the SWIR bands, giving lower RMSD and MARD especially at longer wavelengths ({$>$}600 nm). The results presented in this article should serve as guidelines for general use of ACOLITE and the DSF.},

  abstract = {Coral reefs are the world’s most diverse marine ecosystems that provide resources and services that benefit millions of people globally. Yet, coral reefs have recently experienced an increase in the frequency and intensity of thermal-stress events that are causing coral bleaching. Coral bleaching is a result of the breakdown of the symbiosis between corals and their symbiotic microalgae, causing the loss of pigments and symbionts, giving corals a pale, bleached appearance. Bleaching can be temporary or fatal for corals, depending on the species, the geographic location, historical conditions, and on local and regional influences. Indeed, marine heat waves are the greatest threat to corals worldwide. Here we compile a Global Coral-Bleaching Database (GCBD) that encompasses 34,846 coral bleaching records from 14,405 sites in 93 countries, from 1980–2020. The GCBD provides vital information on the presence or absence of coral bleaching along with site exposure, distance to land, mean turbidity, cyclone frequency, and a suite of sea-surface temperature metrics at the times of survey.},

  abstract = {Localized pollution of coral reef areas is occurring at Aqaba, Red Sea, as a result of sewage discharge, and as a result of spillage of phosphate dust during loading of phosphate mineral onto ships. The rate of death of colonies of the coral Stylophora pistillata was found to be 4–5 times as great in the polluted area as in a control area. Coral damage in the control area is generally caused by grazing or by extreme low tide, but the cause of coral death in the polluted area was not readily apparent. The growth of algae, both on the damaged corals, and on glass slides placed out in the reef, was greatly stimulated in the polluted area, but it appeared that such algal growth was not the direct cause of coral death. Corals in the polluted area may be under stress because of reduced light intensity, inhibition of calcification by excess phosphate, and increased sediment load. It was found that in the polluted area there was a greater weight of sediment settling on the glass slides for a given weight of algae. But in addition, since algal growth was faster in the polluted area, the sediment load was increased by the sediment trapping capacity of the enhanced algal growth. Thus it is suggested that increased algal growth stimulated by increased nutrient concentrations may be important in greatly increasing the sediment load experienced by corals.},

  abstract = {This research was aimed at developing the mapping model of benthic habitat mapping using machine-learning classification algorithms and tested the applicability of the model in different areas. We integrated in situ benthic habitat data and image processing of WorldView-2 (WV2) image to parameterise the machine-learning algorithm, namely: Random Forest (RF), Classification Tree Analysis (CTA), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification inputs are sunglint-free bands, water column corrected bands, Principle Component (PC) bands, bathymetry, and the slope of underwater topography. Kemujan Island was used in developing the model, while Karimunjawa, Menjangan Besar, and Menjangan Kecil Islands served as test areas. The results obtained indicated that RF was more accurate than any other classification algorithm based on the statistics and benthic habitats spatial distribution. The maximum accuracy of RF was 94.17\% (4 classes) and 88.54\% (14 classes). The accuracies from RF, CTA, and SVM were consistent across different input bands for each classification scheme. The application of RF model in the classification of benthic habitat in other areas revealed that it is recommended to make use of the more general classification scheme in order to avoid several issues regarding benthic habitat variations. The result also established the possibility of mapping a benthic habitat without the use of training areas.},

Now, having collected earth observation data for well over four decades since the 1972 launch of Landsat-1, the Landsat program is increasingly complex and vibrant. Critical programmatic elements are ensuring the continuity of high quality measurements for scientific and operational investigations, including ground systems, acquisition planning, data archiving and management, and provision of analysis ready data products. Free and open access to archival and new imagery has resulted in a myriad of innovative applications and novel scientific insights. The planning of future compatible satellites in the Landsat series, which maintain continuity while incorporating technological advancements, has resulted in an increased operational use of Landsat data. Governments and international agencies, among others, can now build an expectation of Landsat data into a given operational data stream. International programs and conventions (e.g., deforestation monitoring, climate change mitigation) are empowered by access to systematically collected and calibrated data with expected future continuity further contributing to the existing multi-decadal record. The increased breadth and depth of Landsat science and applications have accelerated following the launch of Landsat-8, with significant improvements in data quality. Herein, we describe the programmatic developments and institutional context for the Landsat program and the unique ability of Landsat to meet the needs of national and international programs. We then present the key trends in Landsat science that underpin many of the recent scientific and application developments and follow-up with more detailed thematically organized summaries. The historical context offered by archival imagery combined with new imagery allows for the development of time series algorithms that can produce information on trends and dynamics. Landsat-8 has figured prominently in these recent developments, as has the improved understanding and calibration of historical data. Following the communication of the state of Landsat science, an outlook for future launches and envisioned programmatic developments are presented. Increased linkages between satellite programs are also made possible through an expectation of future mission continuity, such as developing a virtual constellation with Sentinel-2. Successful science and applications developments create a positive feedback loop—justifying and encouraging current and future programmatic support for Landsat.},

  abstract = {Sentinel-2 mission has been shown to have promising applications in coral reef remote sensing because of its superior properties. It has a 5-day revisit time, spatial resolution of 10 m, free data, etc. In this study, Sentinel-2 imagery was investigated for bleaching detection through simulations and a case study over the Lizard Island, Australia. The spectral and image simulations based on the semianalytical (SA) model and the sensor spectral response function, respectively, confirmed that coral bleaching cannot be detected only using one image, and the change analysis was proposed for detection because there will be a featured change signal for bleached corals. Band 2 of Sentinel-2 is superior to its other bands for the overall consideration of signal attenuation and spatial resolution. However, the detection capability of Sentinel-2 is still limited by the water depth. With rapid signal attenuation due to the water absorption effect, the applicable water depth for bleaching detection was recommended to be less than 10 m. The change analysis was conducted using two methods: one radiometric normalization with pseudo invariant features (PIFs) and the other with multi-temporal depth invariant indices (DII). The former performed better than the latter in terms of classification. The bleached corals maps obtained using the PIFs and DII approaches had an overall accuracy of 88.9 and 57.1\%, respectively. Compared with the change analysis based on two dated images, the use of a third image that recorded the spectral signals of recovered corals or corals overgrown by algae after bleaching significantly improved the detection accuracy. All the preliminary results of this article will aid in the future studies on coral bleaching detection based on remote sensing.},

  abstract = {Monitoring of coral reef bleaching has hitherto been based on regional-scale, in situ data. Larger-scale trends, however, must be determined using satellite-based observations. Using both a radiative transfer simulation and an analysis of multitemporal Landsat TM images, the ability of satellite remote sensing to detect and monitor coral reef bleaching is examined. The radiative transfer simulation indicates that the blue and green bands of Landsat TM can detect bleaching if at least 23\% of the coral surface in a pixel has been bleached, assuming a Landsat TM pixel with a resolution of 30Â30 m on shallow (less than 3 m deep) reef flats at Ishigaki Island, Japan. Assuming an area with an initial coral coverage of 100\% and in which all corals became completely bleached, the bleaching could be detected at a depth of up to 17 m. The difference in reflectance of shallow sand and corals is compared by examining multitemporal Landsat TM images at Ishigaki Island, after normalizing for variations in atmospheric conditions, incident light, water depth, and the sensor’s reaction to the radiance received. After the normalization, a severe bleaching event when 25 – 55\% of coral coverage was bleached was detected, but a slight bleaching event when 15\% of coral coverage was bleached was not detected. The simulation and data analysis agreed well with each other, and identified reliable limits for satellite remote sensing for detecting coral reef bleaching. Sensitivity analysis on solar zenith angle, aerosol (visibility) and water quality (Chl a concentration) quantified the effect of these factors on bleaching detection, and thus served as general guidelines for detecting coral reef bleaching. Spatial misregistration resulted in a high degree of uncertainty in the detection of changes at the edges of coral patches mainly because of the low (f30 m) spatial resolution of Landsat TM, indicating that detection of coral reef bleaching by Landsat TM is limited to extremely severe cases on a large homogeneous coral patch and shallow water depths. Satellite remote sensing of coral reef bleaching should be encouraged, however, because the development and deployment of advanced satellite sensors with high spatial resolution continue to progress.},

  abstract = {We present results of the quantitative monitoring and assessment of suspended sediment in Yellow River estuary from the imagery of TM and ETM+(TM/ETM+) aboard Landsat satellites. The estuary is one of the world's most turbid areas with high concentration of suspended sediment (SSC). As a result, an atmospheric correction algorithm is required for TM/ETM+ when applied to monitor SSC in the estuary. Remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at TM/ETM+ bands is retrieved using the air molecule and aerosol scattering information provided by MODIS aboard Terra satellite, which has highly improved radiometric calibration, sensitivity, and spectral bands designed for estimating aerosol radiance. Rrs at the red band is used for retrieving SSC by means of the model developed from in-situ data. TM/ETM+ measured water color products (Rrs and SSC) are cross validated with MODIS measurements, which are validated by contemporaneous in-situ data. The cross validation shows that, with the proper atmospheric correction algorithm and retrieval model, TM/ETM+ data can be used to quantify the SSC in Yellow River estuary. Interannual and seasonal variations, as well as spatial distribution, of SSC in Yellow River estuary are studied and assessed using TM/ETM+ measurements from 2000 to 2010. Results show that the SSC is generally increasing from 2000 to the maximum in 2003 and then decreasing and is highly correlated with the annual total sediment discharge from Yellow River. The correlation is not so high for the SSC in Bohai and Laizhou bays. In addition, the SSC in the estuary is generally increasing from June to the maximum in Nov. and then decreasing to the minimum in April. The seasonal variation pattern results from Yellow River sediment discharge, which is higher in June–Nov., corresponding to the flood season than in other months. The SSC in Laizhou and Bohai bays generally follow the same seasonal variation pattern that is higher in Nov.–Apr. than in other months. The higher SSC mainly results from the wind-driven resuspension of bottom sediment.},

  abstract = {Accurate mapping and effective monitoring of benthic habitat in the Florida Keys are critical in developing management strategies for this valuable coral reef ecosystem. For this study, a framework was designed for automated benthic habitat mapping by combining multiple data sources (hyperspectral, aerial photography, and bathymetry data) and four contemporary imagery processing techniques (data fusion, Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA), machine learning, and ensemble analysis). In the framework, 1-m digital aerial photograph was first merged with 17-m hyperspectral imagery and 10-m bathymetry data using a pixel/feature-level fusion strategy. The fused dataset was then preclassified by three machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and k-Nearest Neighbor). Final object-based habitat maps were produced through ensemble analysis of outcomes from three classifiers. The framework was tested for classifying a group-level (3-class) and code-level (9-class) habitats in a portion of the Florida Keys. Informative and accurate habitat maps were achieved with an overall accuracy of 88.5\% and 83.5\% for the group-level and code-level classifications, respectively.},
