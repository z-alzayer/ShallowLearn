# ShallowLearn: Shallow Water Imaging in Python

## Overview

ShallowLearn is a Python package for processing and analyzing imagery data of shallow water environments. This package is designed to provide an efficient and effective way to calculate common indices used in marine and environmental science. These include Chlorophyll Index (CI), Ocean Color Index (OCI), Suspended Sediment Index (SSI), Turbidity Index (TI), Water Quality Index (WQI), and Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI). Additionally, ShallowLearn features tools for effective visualization of multispectral band data with histogram and color mapping functionality.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

ShallowLearn uses the conda package manager to handle its environment. All necessary packages are listed in the `environment.yml` file. The key dependencies include `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `ipywidgets`.

### Installation
